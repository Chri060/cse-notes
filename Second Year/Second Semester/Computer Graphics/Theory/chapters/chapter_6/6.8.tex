\section{Compute pipeline}

The compute pipeline serves a distinct purpose from rendering images, focusing on performing General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) computations. 
In this scenario, the application provides a single shader, known as the Compute Shader, which executes the desired operations.

Data required for computation is copied into buffers in GPU memory, if available. 
Compute shader executions are identified by a (up to) tridimensional index. 
This index, often referred to as a vector index, allows the shader to access data and determine the partition on which it can work. 
By utilizing this index, the shader can efficiently perform computations on the provided data.
