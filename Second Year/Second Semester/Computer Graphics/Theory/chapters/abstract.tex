    The course outline is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Rendering pipeline, and hardware and software architectures for 3D graphics.
        \item Basic transformation: translation, rotation, scaling and projection.
        \item Basic of computational geometry, clipping and hidden surface removal.
        \item Lighting: light sources, materials, shaders, surface normal.
        \item Texture: projection, mapping, texture animation, alpha mapping, bump mapping, normal mapping.
        \item Advanced effects: reflection maps, BRDF models, environment maps, global illumination maps.
        \item Animation: scene graph, BÃ©zier curves, quaternion.
    \end{itemize}
