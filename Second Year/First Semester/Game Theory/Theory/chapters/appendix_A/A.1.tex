\section{Binary sum}

Define an operation $\oplus$ on $\mathbb{N}=\{0, 1, 2, \dots, n, \dots \}$ in the following way: for $n_1,n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write $n_1$, $_n2$ in binary form, denoted by $[n_1]_2$, $[n_2]_2$. 
    \item Write the sum $[n_1]_2 \oplus [n_2]_2$ in binary form where $\oplus$ is the (usual) sum, but without carry.
    \item What you get is the result in binary form. 
\end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
    The $\oplus$ operation applied to 1,2,4, and 1.
    In binary they are 001 010, 100, and 001. 
    The sum is 110, thus 6. 
\end{example}
