\section{Deep learning}

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, focuses on utilizing large datasets and substantial computational power to automatically learn data representations. 
In certain cases, traditional classification may fail due to the presence of irrelevant or redundant features in the dataset. 
Deep learning addresses this issue by learning optimal features directly from the data, which are then used by machine learning algorithms to perform more accurate classifications. 
Essentially, deep learning involves learning how to represent data in a way that improves the performance of machine learning models.
