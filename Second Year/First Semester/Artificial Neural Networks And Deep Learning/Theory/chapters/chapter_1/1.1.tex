\section{Introduction}

\begin{definition}[\textit{Machine Learning}]
    A computer program is considered to learn from experience $E$ with respect to a specific class of tasks $T$ and a performance measure $P$ if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.
\end{definition}
Given a dataset $\mathcal{D} = {x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N}$, Machine Learning can be broadly categorized into three types:
\begin{itemize} 
    \item \textit{Supervised learning}: in this type of learning, the model is provided with desired outputs ${t_1, t_2, \dots, t_N}$ and learns to produce the correct output for new input data. 
        The primary tasks in supervised learning are: 
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item \textit{Classification}: the model is trained on a labeled dataset and returns a label for new data. 
            \item \textit{Regression}: the model is trained on a dataset with numerical values and returns a number as the output. 
        \end{itemize} 
    \item \textit{Unsupervised learning}: here, the model identifies patterns and regularities within the dataset $\mathcal{D}$ without being provided with explicit labels. 
        The main task in unsupervised learning is: 
        \begin{itemize} 
            \item \textit{Clustering}: the model groups similar data elements based on inherent similarities within the dataset. 
        \end{itemize} 
    \item \textit{Reinforcement learning}: in this approach, the model interacts with the environment by performing actions ${a_1, a_2, \dots, a_N}$ and receives rewards ${r_1, r_2, \dots, r_N}$ in return. 
        The model learns to maximize cumulative rewards over time by adjusting its actions. 
\end{itemize}
