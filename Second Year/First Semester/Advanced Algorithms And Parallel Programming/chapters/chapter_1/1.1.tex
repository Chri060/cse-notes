\begin{definition}[\textit{Algorithm}]
    An algorithm is a well-defined computational procedure that accepts one or more input values and produces one or more output values.
\end{definition}
The problem statement outlines the desired relationship between input and output in broad terms, while the algorithm provides a detailed procedure to achieve that relationship.
It is essential that an algorithm terminates after a finite number of steps.
