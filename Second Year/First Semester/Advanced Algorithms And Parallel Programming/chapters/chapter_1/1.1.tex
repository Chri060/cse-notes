\begin{definition}[\textit{Algorithm}]
    An algorithm is a clearly defined computational procedure that accepts one or more input values and produces one or more output values.
\end{definition}
An algorithm can be seen as a tool for solving a clearly defined computational problem. 
The problem statement outlines the desired relationship between input and output in broad terms, while the algorithm provides a detailed procedure to achieve that relationship.

It is essential that an algorithm terminates after a finite number of steps.
