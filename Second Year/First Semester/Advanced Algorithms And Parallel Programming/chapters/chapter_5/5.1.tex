\section{Introduction}

The term dynamic programming was originally used in the 1940s by Richard Bellman to describe the process of solving problems where one needs to find the best decisions one after another.
The word dynamic was chosen by Bellman to capture the time-varying aspect of the problems.
The word programming referred to the use of the method to find an optimal program, in the sense of a military schedule for training or logistics.
