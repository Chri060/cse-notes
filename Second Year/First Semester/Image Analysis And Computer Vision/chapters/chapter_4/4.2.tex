\section{Points}

Points in space geometry can be represented in Cartesian coordinates by defining a Euclidean space with its origin. 
This approach allows for the unambiguous definition of every point using three Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$.

However, when analyzing images, it is more convenient to employ homogeneous coordinates. 
The relationship between Cartesian and homogeneous coordinates is as follows:    \[
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
    x \\
    y \\
    z \\
    w
\end{bmatrix}
=w
\begin{bmatrix}
    X \\
    Y \\
    Z \\
    1 
\end{bmatrix}
\]
This representation exhibits homogeneity, meaning any vector $x$ is equivalent to all its non-zero multiples $\lambda x$, where $\lambda \neq 0$, since they all represent the same point.
The null vector, however, does not represent any point.
\begin{definition}
    The \emph{projective space} is defined as:
    \[\mathbb{P}^3=\{{\begin{bmatrix} x & y & z & w \end{bmatrix}}^T \in \mathbb{R}^4\}-\{{\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}}^T\}\]
\end{definition}
