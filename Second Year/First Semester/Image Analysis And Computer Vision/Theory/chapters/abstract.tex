    The topics of the course are: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Introduction.
        \item Camera sensors: transduction, optics, geometry, distortion
        \item Basics on Projective geometry: modelling basic primitives (points, lines, planes, conic sections, quadric surfaces) and projective spatial transformations and  projections.
        \item Camera geometry, and single view analysis: calibration, image rectification, localization of 3D models.
        \item Multi-view analysis: 3D shape reconstruction, self-calibration, 3D scene understanding.
        \item Linear filters and convolutions, space-invariant filters, Fourier Transform, sampling and aliasing. 
        \item Nonlinear filters: image morphology and morphology operators (dilate, erode, open, close), median filters.
        \item Edge detection and feature detection techniques. Feature matching and feature tracking along image sequences.
        \item Inferring parametric models from noisy data (including outliers), contour segmentation, clustering, Hough Transform, Ransac (random sample consensus). 
        \item Applications: object tracking, object recognition, classification.
    \end{itemize}
