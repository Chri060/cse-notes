\section{NoSQL Databases}

NoSQL databases are designed to provide greater flexibility in handling data, making them ideal for systems that require scalable and dynamic data structures. 
Unlike traditional relational databases, which rely on rigid schemas, most NoSQL databases operate without an explicit schema, or they may have an implicit, flexible schema that can evolve over time.

The absence of a fixed schema allows NoSQL databases to handle a wide variety of data formats, making them suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data, such as JSON, XML, or key-value pairs. 
This flexibility enables the efficient storage and retrieval of large-scale data in modern applications, where data structures may change frequently and unpredictably.
