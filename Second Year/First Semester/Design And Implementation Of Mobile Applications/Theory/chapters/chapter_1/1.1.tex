\section{Introduction}

The history of mobile devices began in 1973 when Martin Cooper at Motorola made the first analog call in the United States using a prototype.
Modern devices, however, are equipped with a range of advanced sensors such as an accelerometer, gyroscope, digital compass, GPS, barometer, ambient light sensor, and proximity sensor.
