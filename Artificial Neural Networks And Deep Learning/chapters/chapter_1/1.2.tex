\section{Deep Learning}

Deep Learning is a specialized branch of Machine Learning that leverages Neural Networks with multiple layers to process and learn from vast amounts of data. 
Its core strength lies in automatically learning meaningful data representations, enabling it to tackle complex problems that traditional Machine Learning methods struggle with.

Traditional Machine Learning methods often rely on hand-engineered features, which are predefined attributes or patterns extracted from the data. 
However, these approaches can fail when:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The dataset contains irrelevant or redundant features that obscure meaningful patterns.
    \item The relationships in the data are too intricate to be captured by manual feature engineering.
\end{itemize}
Deep Learning overcomes these limitations by automatically learning hierarchical representations of data, where higher layers in the network capture increasingly abstract and complex features.
This ability to learn directly from raw data eliminates the need for extensive manual feature engineering, making Deep Learning especially effective for high-dimensional and unstructured data such as images, audio, and text.
