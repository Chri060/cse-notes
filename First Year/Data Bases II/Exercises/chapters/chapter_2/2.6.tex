\section{Update locks}

Update lock was introduced to contrast deadlocks. Can we state that deadlocks are impossible in the presence of update locks?
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If so, concisely explain why. 
    \item If not, provide a counter-example.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Clearly deadlocks are possible in the presence of UL. Indeed, UL only makes deadlock less likely, by preventing one type of deadlock, due to 
        update patterns, when two transactions compete for the same resource ($r_1(x) r_2(x) w_1(x) w_2(x)$). 
    \item Consider two distinct resources $X$ and $Y$, and two transactions that want to access them in this order: $r_1(X) r_2(Y) w_1(Y) w_2(X)$. It is likely that they end up 
        in deadlock, especially if the system on which they run applies 2PL. UL is totally irrelevant here, because there is no update pattern. 
\end{enumerate}
