\section{Schedule classification}

Classify the following schedule with respect to CSR and VSR classes:  
\[r_1(x) r_2(y) w_3(y) r_5(x) w_5(u) w_3(s)w_2(u) w_3(x) w_1(u) r_4(y) w_5(z) r_5(z) r_2(u) w_2(s)\]

\paragraph*{Solution}
Since CSR contains VSR we check with the conflict graph. To do so we first divide the schedule based on the resources: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x: r_1 \: r_5 \: w_3$
    \item $y: r_2 \: w_3 \: r_4$
    \item $z: w_5 \: r_5$
    \item $s: w_3 \: w_2$
    \item $u: w_5 \: w_2 \: w_1 \: r_2$
\end{itemize}
The nodes are $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$ and the arcs are found with the write-write or write-read relations found in the previous groups. So we have the following graph:

In this case it is not possible to find a VSR schedule because it is impossible to do so without changing the final write on $s$.
