\section{Physical database}

Consider the following tables: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item STUDENT(SNumber, Name, Surname, Address, BirthDate, $\dots$)
        This table has 64000 students in 15000 blocks, with a primary hash structure on SNumber and filling factor below 50\%. 
    \item EXAM(SNumber, CourseCode, Date, Grade)
        This table has 180000 tuples in a primary B+ tree structure with SNumber as access key, an average fan-out of 22, and such that the leaf nodes have overall a size of 10000 blocks. 
\end{itemize}
Calculate as accurately as possible the cost of joining the two tables according to the most convenient join method given the access structures.
Then, also calculate the join cost in case \texttt{EXAM} were, instead, structured according to the same hash as \texttt{STUDENT}.
