\section{Schedule classification}

Classify the following schedule:
\[r_1(X) w_1(Y) w_2(Y) w_3(Z) r_1(Z) w_4(X) r_4(Y) w_3(X) r_5(Y) w_5(X)\] 

\paragraph*{Solution}
First, we check if it is CSR:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X: r_1 w_4 w_3 w_5$
    \item $Y: w_1 w_2 r_4 r_5$
    \item $Z: w_3 r_1$
\end{itemize}
We found a cycle between the nodes three and one, so it is not CSR. It is also not VSR. We now check for TS using the same list: 
we find that $w_4 w_3$ are not in the correct order, so it is not in TS-mono, neither in TS-multi (it is a write that causes the 
problem).
