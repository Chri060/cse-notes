    The course aims to prepare software designers on the effective development of database applications. 
    
    First, the course presents the fundamental features of current database architectures, with a specific emphasis on the concept of transaction and its realization in centralized 
    and distributed systems. 
    
    Then, the course illustrates the main directions in the evolution of database systems, presenting approaches that go beyond the relational model, like active databases, object 
    systems and XML data management solutions.
