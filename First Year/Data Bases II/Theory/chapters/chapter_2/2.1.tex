\section{Introduction}

A Database Management System (DBMS) typically oversees the management of multiple applications.
An essential metric for evaluating the workload of a DBMS is the number of transactions per second ("tps") that it can effectively handle. 
Efficient database utilization requires the DBMS to manage concurrency effectively while preventing the occurrence of anomalies. 
This is achieved through a concurrency control system, which is responsible for determining the order in which various transactions are scheduled.
