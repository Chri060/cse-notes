\section{Strict two-phase and predicate locking}

\begin{definition}
    In \emph{strict two-phase locking} (or long duration locks) we also have that locks held by a transaction can be released only after commit or rollback.
\end{definition}
This locking variant is employed in many commercial database management systems (DBMS) when a high level of isolation is necessary.

To counteract phantom inserts, a lock should also be applied to future data using predicate locks. 
When a predicate lock is placed on a resource, other transactions are restricted from inserting, deleting, or updating any tuple that satisfies this predicate.
