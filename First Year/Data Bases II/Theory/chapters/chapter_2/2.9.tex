\section{Strict two-phase and predicate locking}

\begin{definition}
    In \emph{strict two-phase locking} (or long duration locks) we also have that locks held by a transaction can be released only after commit or rollback.
\end{definition}
This version of locking is used in most commercial DBMS whenever a high level of isolation is required. 

To prevent phantom inserts a lock should be placed also on future data using the predicate locks. If the predicate lock is on a resource, other transactions cannot insert, delete, 
or update any tuple satisfying this predicate.
