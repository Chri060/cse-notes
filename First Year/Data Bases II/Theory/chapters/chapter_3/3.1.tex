\section{Introduction}

It is possible to create ranking to get the best result out of the data using the multi-objective optimization (simultaneous optimization of different criteria). 

A general multi-objective problem can be formulated as follows: given $N$ objects described by $d$ attributes, we need to find the best $k$ objects. 

The main approaches to solve the multi-objective optimization are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ranking queries: selects the top $k$ objects according to a given scoring function.
    \item Skyline queries: selects the set of non-dominated objects. 
\end{itemize}
