\section{Introduction}

Achieving optimal results from data can be accomplished through the application of ranking, involving the simultaneous optimization of various criteria.

A typical formulation for a multi-objective problem is as follows: with $N$ objects characterized by $d$ attributes, the objective is to identify the top $k$ objects.

The primary methods for addressing multi-objective optimization include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ranking queries: this approach involves selecting the top $k$ objects based on a specified scoring function.
    \item Skyline queries: this method focuses on choosing the set of non-dominated objects, ensuring they are not inferior in any criterion.
\end{itemize}
