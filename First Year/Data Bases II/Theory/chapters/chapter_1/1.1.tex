\section{Data Base Management System}

\begin{definition}[\textit{DataBase Management System}]
    A DBMS is a software product capable of managing data collections that are: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Large}: much larger than the central memory available on the computers that run the software. 
        \item \textit{Persistent}: with a lifetime which is independent of single executions of the programs that access them. 
        \item \textit{Shared}: used by several applications at a time. 
        \item \textit{Reliable}: ensuring tolerance to hardware and software failures. 
        \item \textit{Data ownership respectful}: by disciplining and controlling accesses.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
