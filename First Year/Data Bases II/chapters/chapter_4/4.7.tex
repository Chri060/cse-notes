\section{Benefits of Java Persistence API}

The main benefits of using the Java Persistence API are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item No need to write SQL code.
    \item Application code ignores table names, since the mapping is expressed via annotations with defaults. 
    \item No need to create/destroy the connection. 
    \item No need to create and terminate the transaction. 
    \item Business objects methods are automatically made transactional. 
    \item Default transactional behavior, with annotations to specify different transaction management policies. 
\end{itemize}
