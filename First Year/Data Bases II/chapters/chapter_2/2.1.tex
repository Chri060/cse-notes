\section{Introduction}

A Database Management System DBMS typically manage multiple applications.
An essential metric for evaluating the workload of a DBMS is the number of transactions per second (\texttt{tps}) that it can effectively handle. 
Efficient database utilization requires the DBMS to manage concurrency effectively while preventing the occurrence of anomalies. 
This is achieved through a concurrency control system, which is responsible for determining the order in which various transactions are scheduled.
