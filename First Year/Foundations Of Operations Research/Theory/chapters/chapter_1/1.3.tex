\section{History}

During World War II, groups of scientists were tasked with conducting research to determine the most effective methods for conducting military operations. 
In the years following the war, these techniques were declassified and began to be adopted on a broader scale, addressing various challenges in the realms of business, industry, and society. 
The post-war industrial expansion led to the growth of companies and organizations, which, in turn, gave rise to increasingly intricate decision-making dilemmas. 
This transformation was facilitated by the rapid advancements in Operations Research, numerical analysis methodologies, and the widespread adoption of computer technology.
