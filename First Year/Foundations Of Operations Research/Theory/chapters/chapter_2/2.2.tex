\section{Definitions}

\begin{definition}
    An algorithm is considered \emph{exact} when it is capable of delivering an optimal solution for every single instance.

    In contrast, an algorithm is deemed \emph{heuristic} when it is not guaranteed to provide an optimal solution for all instances.

    A \emph{greedy algorithm} progressively builds a feasible solution by consistently making locally optimal choices at each step, without revisiting or reevaluating prior selections.
