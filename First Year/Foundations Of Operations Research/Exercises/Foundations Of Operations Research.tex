    \section{Linear programming modeling}
        A bank has a capital of $C$ billions of Euro and two available stocks:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item With an annual revenue of $15\%$ and risk factor of $\dfrac{1}{3}$. 
            \item With an annual revenue of $25\%$ and risk factor of $1$.
        \end{enumerate}
        The risk factor represents the maximum fraction of the stock value that can be lost. A risk factor of $25\%$ implies that, if stocks are bought for $100$ euro up to $25$ euro 
        can be lost. It is required that at least half of $C$ is risk-free. The amount of money used to buy stocks of two must not be larger than two times that used to buy stocks of one. 
        At least $\dfrac{1}{6}$ of C must be invested into one. 
        
        Give a Linear Programming formulation for the problem of determining an optimal portfolio for which the profit is maximized. 
        Solve the problem graphically.
    \subsection*{Solution}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The parameters are: 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The quantity of available capital $C$. 
                \end{itemize}
            \item The decision variables are:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The amount of money invested in stock of type one $x_1$. 
                    \item The amount of money invested in stock of type two $x_2$. 
                \end{itemize}
            \item The objective function is: 
                \[\max{\left[0.15x_1+0.25x_2\right]}\]
            \item The constraints are:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Maximum capital: 
                        \[x_1+x_2 \leq C\]
                    \item Half of the invested capital is risk-free:
                        \[\dfrac{1}{3}x_1+x_2 \leq \dfrac{C}{2}\]
                    \item The amount of money used to buy stocks of two must not be larger than two times that used to buy stocks of one:
                        \[x_2 \leq 2x_1\]
                    \item At least $\dfrac{1}{6}$ of $C$ must be invested into one: 
                        \[x_1 \geq \dfrac{1}{6}C\]
                    \item Constraint on the variables:
                        \[x_1,x_2 \geq 0\]
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        To solve the problem graphically, we must identify the feasible region in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that satisfies the constraints. To draw a constraint, it suffices to find any two points 
        that satisfy it with equality (as an equation). The border of the constraint is then represented by the only line containing such points. There are two possible ways to identify 
        which of the two half planes is the feasible one:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In the first one, it suffices to pick a random point and checking whether it satisfies the constraint. If it does, the half space to which the point belongs is the
            feasible one, otherwise the other half space is.
            \item Alternatively, we can consider the gradient of the constraint and compare it to the direction of the inequality. 
        \end{itemize}
        The region found with the constraints is the following:
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/plane.png}
        \end{figure}
        The feasible region is as shown in the picture. To find the feasible point where the objective function attains its maximal value, we can draw the level curves 
        $f(x_1,x_2)=0.15x_1+0.25x_2=z$ where each level curve is the set of points whose objective function value is equal to $z$, for any constant $z$. 
        
        Since $f$ is linear, the level curve $f(x_1,x_2) = z$ is a line, orthogonal to its gradient, and parametric in $z$. When $z$ is increased, we obtain parallel level lines that 
        move towards the direction of the gradient $\nabla f (x_1,x_2)$. 

        Note that, by starting with $z = 0$ and by increasing it in a continuous way, the level lines of f will first intersect the feasible region at $\left(\dfrac{C}{6}, 0\right)$, and then, 
        increasing $z$, at any other point, until the intersection is empty. The last feasible point having a nonempty intersection is the maximizer of $f$ over the feasible set. 
        In this problem there is a single maximizer. The maximizer, denoted by $x^{*}$, can be found as the solution to the following linear system: 
        \[
        \begin{cases}
            x_1+x_2 = C \\
            \dfrac{1}{3}x_1+x_2 = \dfrac{C}{2}
        \end{cases} 
        \]
        which yields $x^{*}=\left( \dfrac{3C}{4},\dfrac{C}{4} \right)$, where $f(x^{*})=\dfrac{7C}{40}$.

        Assume that $n$ packets of data must be routed from node $s$ to node $t$, along one of two available links, with capacity (bandwidth)$ k_1 = 1 \: Mbps$ and $k_2 = 2 \: Mbps$. 
        \begin{figure}[H]

            \includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{images/link.png}
        \end{figure}
        The cost per unit of capacity of link $2$ is $30\%$ larger than that of link $1$. The following table indicates the quantity of capacity consumed by each packet 
        $i$, $i \in {l,\dots,n}$, and the cost to route it on link $1$.

        Give an integer linear programming formulation for the problem of minimizing the total cost of routing all the packets. Give also an integer linear programming formulation for 
        the more general case where $m$ links are available. 
    \subsection*{Solution}
        The 2-link case can be formulated as the following integer linear program. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The sets are: 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The set of packets $I=\{1,\dots,n\}$. 
                    \item The set of links $J=\{1,\dots,m\}$. 
                \end{itemize}
            \item The parameters are: 
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The capacity consumed by packet $i$, for $i \in I$ $a_i$.
                    \item The routing cost for packet $i$ on link $j$, for $i \in I,j \in J$ $c_{ij}$.
                    \item The capacity for link $j$ and $j \in J$ $k_{j}$. 
                \end{itemize}
            \item The decision variables are:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item $x_ij$: $1$ if packet $i$ is routed on link $j$, or 0 otherwise, for $i \in I,j \in J$
                \end{itemize}
            \item The objective function is: 
                \[\min{\sum_{i \in I}{c_{ij}x_{ij}}}\]
            \item The constraints are:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The assignment: 
                        \[\sum_{j \in J}x_{ij} = 1\]
                    \item The capacity: 
                        \[\sum_{j \in J}a_ix_{ij} \leq k_j\]
                    \item The variables must be binary: 
                        \[x_{ij} \in \{0,1\} \:\:\:\:\:\: i \in I,j \in J\]
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
        The $m$-link formulation requires a new set of binary variables, one for each packet and link. The packet-to-link assignment is also to be explicitly introduced.

        A company $A$, which produces one type of high-precision measuring instrument, has to plan the production for the next 3 months. Each month, $A$ can produce at most 110 units, 
        at a unit cost of 300 Euro. Moreover, each month, up to 60 additional units produced by another company B can be bought at a unit cost of 330 Euro. Unsold units can be 
        stored. The inventory cost is of 10 Euro per unit of product, per month. Sales forecasts indicate a demand of 100, 130, and 150 units of product for the next 3 months.

            \item Give a linear programming formulation for the problem of determining a production plan (direct or indirect) which minimizes the total costs, while satisfying 
                the monthly demands.
            \item Give a mixed integer linear programming formulation for the variant of the problem where production lots have a minimum size. In particular, if any strictly 
                positive quantity is produced in a given month, this quantity cannot be smaller than 15 units.

                                \[x_{t-1}+x_t+x_t^{'} \geq d_t\]
                            \item The inventory balance:

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item The minimum lot size: 
                        \[x_t \geq l_{y_t}\]
                    \item The activation: 
                        \[x_t \leq M_{y_t}\]
                \end{itemize}
                where $l = 15$ is the minimum lot size, and $M$ is a large enough value, such that constraint $x_t \leq M_{y_t}$ is redundant when $y_t=1$. For instance, 
                we can choose $M = 110$. Such constraints are usually called big-$M$ constraints.

    \section{Kruskal's algorithm}
        In 1956 Joseph Kruskal proposed the following greedy algorithm to find a minimum cost spanning tree in an arbitrary connected undirected graph $G = (N, E)$ with a cost
        $c_e$ attached to each edge $e \in E$. 
        \begin{algorithm}[H]
            \caption{Kruskal's algorithm}
                \begin{algorithmic}[1]
                    \State sort the edges of $E$ as $\{e_1,\dots,e_m\}$ where $c_{e_1} \leq c_{e_2} \leq \dots \leq c_{e_m}$
                    \State $i \leftarrow 1$
                    \State initialize the sub graph $G' = (N, E)$ of $G$ with $F=\varnothing$
                    \While {$\left\lvert F \right\rvert < n-1$}
                        \If {the two endpoints of the edge $e_i$ belong to different connected components of the current sub graph $G^{'}$}
                            \State $F \leftarrow F \cup \{e_i\}$
                            \State merge the two connected components 
                        \EndIf 
                        \State $i \leftarrow i+1$
                    \EndWhile
                    \State \Return the spanning tree $G^{'} = (N, E)$ 
                \end{algorithmic}
        \end{algorithm}
        In other words, we order the edges by increasing (non-decreasing) cost, we consider the edges in that order and, at each step, we select the current edge (which is 
        one of the cheapest edges still available) only if it does not create a cycle with the previously selected edges. The algorithm terminates when $n-1$ edges have
        been selected. 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Describe an efficient way to identify/keep track of the connected components of the sub graph $G^{'}$ and to check that a new edge is creating a cycle with 
                the previously selected edges (is connecting two distinct connected components of $G^{''}$). Determine the overall computational complexity of this 
                implementation of Kruskal's algorithm. 
            \item By invoking the optimality condition for minimum-cost spanning trees, verify that Kruskal's algorithm is exact. 
            \item Find the maximum-cost spanning tree in the graph of the previous exercise by using a straightforward adaptation of Kruskal's algorithm. 
        \end{enumerate}
    \subsection*{Solution}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item To identify/keep track of the connected components (subtrees) of the sub graph $G$, we use a vector $v$ with as many components as vertices in the graph, 
                where $v_i$ indicates the index of the connected component containing node $i$. At the beginning of the algorithm, we start with $v_i=i$, for $i = 1,\dots,n$. 
                When an edge $e = {i,j}$ is considered for addition to $G^{''}$, we compare the values $v_i$ and $v_j$. If $v_i \neq v_j$, then we can add the edge e to $G^{'}$ 
                because it does not create a cycle. Since the two connected components of indices $v_i$ and $v_j$ are merged, the indices are updated as follows: in the vector $v$
                we substitute each occurrence of the index of node $i$ with that of node $j$. If $v_i = v_j$, edge e is skipped because it would create a cycle. 
            \item The $m$ edges can be ordered by non-decreasing cost in $O(m\log m)$, which is $O(m \log n)$ since $m\log m \leq m\log n^2 = 2m\log n$. At most $m$ edges are 
                considered for addition to the current sub graph $G^{'}$. At each iteration, an edge $e = {i,j}$ is considered and the vector $v$ is updated (in $O(n)$) only if 
                $v_i \neq v_j$. Since a merging operation occurs exactly$ n-1$ times (a spanning tree contains $n-1$ edges), the overall complexity is $O(m\log n + m+n^2)=
                O(mlogn + n^2)$. 
            \item To verify that Kruskal's algorithm is exact, we just need to recall that the edges are considered in order of non-decreasing cost and to invoke the 
            optimality condition for minimum cost spanning tree. Since each edge e that has been discarded (not added to $F$) has a cost $c_e$ which is at least as large as 
            the cost of all the previously selected edges, it is not a cost-decreasing edge. According to the optimality condition for minimum cost spanning trees, the 
            resulting spanning tree is of minimum total cost because no cost-decreasing edge exists. 
        \end{enumerate}
        The execution of the algorithm gives the following result. 
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/kruskal.png}
        \end{figure}

    \newpage
    \section{Optimality check}
        Without applying any one of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms, verify whether the following spanning tree is of minimum cost. 
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/optimality.png}
        \end{figure}
    \subsection*{Solution}
        It suffices to verify that there exists a cost decreasing edge. By inspection, we observe that, by adding edge $\{1,5\}$ to the tree, the cycle 
        $\left\langle 1,5,4,3,2,1\right\rangle$ is introduced. In such cycle, edge $\{4,3\}$ has a strictly larger cost than $\{1,5\}$. Therefore, by removing edge $\{4,3\}$ 
        and adding edge $\{1,5\}$, a spanning tree of strictly smaller total cost is obtained. 

    \newpage
    \section{Compact storage of similar sequences}
        Consider the problem of storing a large set of strings. We assume that the strings have many similar entries (they differ only in a small number of positions) and 
        we wish to store them in a compact way. This problem arises in several contexts such as when storing DNA sequences, where the characters correspond to the four DNA 
        bases. In this exercise, we consider the simplified version of the problem with only two characters. Given a set of $k$ sequences of $M$ bits, we compute for each 
        pair $i,j$, with $1 < i,j < k$, the Hamming distance between the sequences $i$ and $j$, i.e., the number of bits that need to be flipped in sequence $i$ to obtain 
        sequence $j$. This function clearly satisfies the three usual properties of a distance: non-negativity, symmetry and triangle inequality. Consider the following 
        set of $6$ sequences and the corresponding matrix $D = {d_{ij}}$ of Hamming distances 
        \begin{figure}[H]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{images/DNA.png}
        \end{figure}
        where, due to symmetry, only the upper triangle of the matrix is shown. In order to exploit redundancies between sequences and to save memory, we can store: one of 
        the sequences, called the reference sequence, completely and for every other sequence, only the set of bit flips that allow us to retrieve it either directly from 
        the reference sequence or from another sequence. 

        Show how the problem of deciding which differences to memorize, to minimize the total number of bits used for storage, can be reduced to the problem of finding a 
        minimum-cost spanning tree in an appropriate graph. Solve the problem for the given instance. 
    \subsection*{Solution}
        We construct a complete graph $G$ with a node for each sequence and an edge for each pair of sequences. Moreover, each edge $\{i,j\}$ is assigned a cost 
        $d_{ij}\log_2(M)$, which corresponds to the number of bits needed to store the indices of the positions in which the $i$-th and $j$-th sequences differ.
        The problem is then to look for a sub graph $G^{'}$ of $G$ of minimum total cost. Since only one sequence is completely stored, $G^{'}$ must be connected to be 
        able to retrieve any sequence. Since a sub graph of minimal cost is sought, $G^{'}$ will be acyclic. Therefore, a minimum cost spanning tree in $G$ provides an 
        optimal solution to the problem under consideration. The following minimum cost spanning tree has been found using Prim's algorithm.
