\section{Traveling salesman problem}

Given a directed graph $G=(N,A)$ with cost $c_{ij} \in \mathbb{Z}$ for each are $(i,j) \in A$, determine a circuit of minimum total cost visiting every node exactly once. 
\begin{definition}[\textit{Hamiltonian circuit}]
    A Hamiltonian circuit $C$ of $G$ is a circuit that visits every node exactly once. 
\end{definition}
Therefore, by representing $H$ as the set encompassing all Hamiltonian circuits within graph $G$, the problem can be formulated as:
\[\min_{C \in H}{\sum_{(i,j) \in C}{c_{ij}}}\]
It's important to note that this problem is classified as $\mathcal{N}\mathcal{P}$-hard.
