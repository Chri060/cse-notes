\section{Exercise five}

Assuming the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All functional units are pipelined.
    \item ALU operations take 1 cycle.
    \item Memory operations take 2 cycles (includes time in ALU).
    \item Floating-point add instructions take 2 cycles.
    \item Floating-point multiply instructions take 3 cycles.
    \item There is no register renaming. No forwarding.
    \item Instructions are fetched, decoded and issued in order.
    \item The ISSUE stage is a buffer of unlimited length that holds instructions waiting to start execution.
    \item An instruction will only enter the issue stage if it does not cause a WAR or WAW hazard.
    \item Only one instruction can be issued at a time, and in the case multiple instructions are ready, the oldest one will go first.
    \item Program Counter calculation for branches and jumps has been anticipated in the ISSUE stage.
\end{itemize}
Consider the code:
\begin{verbatim}
LOOP:   I1: LD F1, 0 (R2)
        I2: MULTD F2, F1, F1
        I3: ADDD F3, F1, F5
        I4: MULTD F2, F3, F1
        I5: SUBD F5, F1, F5
        I6: SUBI R2, R2, 4
        I7: BNEZ R2, LOOP
\end{verbatim}
Find the conflicts.

\subsection*{Solution}
The conflicts in the given problem are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item RAW F1 I1-I2
    \item RAW F1 I1-I3
    \item RAW F1 I1-I4
    \item RAW F1 I1-I5
    \item RAW F3 I3-I4
    \item RAW R2 I6-I7
    \item WAW F2 I2-I4
    \item WAR F5 I3-I5
    \item WAR R2 I1-I6
    \item CNTRL
\end{itemize}
