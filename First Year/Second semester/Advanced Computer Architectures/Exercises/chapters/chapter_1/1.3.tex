\section{Exercise three}

The speed of image processing on FPGA is $2.86$ times faster than on a CPU.\@
The power consumption of an FPGA is $100\:W$, while that of the CPU is $30.85\:W$.
We want to achieve a speedup of $2$ with the addition of an FPGA.\@

\subsection*{Solution}
To achieve a speedup of $2$ with the addition of an FPGA, we use Amdahl's law:
\[S_{overall}=\dfrac{1}{\left(1-F_{enhanced}\right)+\frac{F_{enhanced}}{S_{enhanced}}}\]
Given $S_{overall} = 2$, we solve for $F_{\text{enhanced}}$:
\[2=\dfrac{1}{\left(1-F_{enhanced}\right)+\frac{F_{enhanced}}{2.86}}\rightarrow F_{enhanced}=0.768\]
Therefore, with $76.8\%$ of the processing offloaded to the FPGA, a speedup of $2$ can be achieved.
