\section{Exercise one}

Assessing the impact of modifications on performance:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Substituting a hardware component with a faster alternative.
    \item Incorporating multiple parallel systems for executing independent tasks.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item By scaling up: response time decreases, while throughput increases.
    \item Through scaling out: throughput experiences an increase.
        Response time will only escalate if a queue was present, awaiting computing resources.
\end{enumerate}
