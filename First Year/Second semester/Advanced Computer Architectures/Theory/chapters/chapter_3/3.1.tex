\section{Introduction}

Developing software has grown increasingly challenging, reaching a point where manually managing all constraints has become nearly impossible. 
With computational power at unprecedented levels, processor cores are abundant, yet energy consumption has emerged as a critical limitation.
Hence, there's a pressing need for software to be mindful of energy usage and space constraints.
