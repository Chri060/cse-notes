\section{Introduction}

Creating software has become progressively more difficult, to the extent that manually handling all the constraints has become almost unmanageable.
Despite the abundance of processor cores due to the unprecedented computational power, energy consumption has become a crucial limitation.
Consequently, there is an urgent requirement for software to prioritize energy efficiency and be mindful of space constraints.
