\section{Speed measures}

To evaluate the speed of two computers, we can utilize two metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{User perspective} Users aim to minimize the elapsed time for program execution, which is measured by the response time: 
        \[T_{response} : T_{execution} = T_{end} - T_{start}\]
    \item \textit{System manager perspective}: system managers aim to maximize the completion rate, or throughput, which refers to the total amount of work done within a specified timeframe.
\end{itemize}
These metrics can be compared using the formula:
\[T_{throughput}=\dfrac{1}{T_{response}}\]
This equality holds true if there are no overlaps; otherwise, a greater throughput is achieved.

Typically, we focus on the common case as it's usually simpler and quicker to assess than the uncommon case.
\begin{theorem}[\textit{Amdahl law}]
    The performance improvement of a system achieved by optimizing a particular part of the system is limited by the fraction of time that part is utilized.
\end{theorem}

Suppose an enhancement $E$ accelerates a fraction $F$ of the task by a factor $S$, while the remainder of the task remains unaffected.
The overall speedup can be calculated as:
\[S_{overall}=\dfrac{1}{\left(1-F_{enhanced}\right)+\frac{F_{enhanced}}{S_{enhanced}}}\]
As a result the best we could ever hope to do is: 
\[\text{Speedup}_{overall}=\dfrac{1}{1-F_{enhanced}}\]
\begin{example}
    Considering a new CPU that is 10 times faster, and an I/O-bound server where 60\% of the time is spent waiting for I/O, the overall speedup would be:
    \[S_{overall}=\dfrac{1}{\left(1-F_{enhanced}\right)+\frac{F_{enhanced}}{S_{enhanced}}}=\dfrac{1}{\left(1-0.4\right)+\frac{0.4}{10}}=1.56\]
    It's important to note that despite the allure of a 10x speed increase, the actual improvement is only 1.6x. 
    This illustrates a fundamental aspect of human perception regarding speed improvements.
\end{example}
\begin{corollary}[\textit{Amdahl's law}]
    If an enhancement is only applicable for a fraction of a task, the task's speed cannot be increased by more than the reciprocal of one minus that fraction.
\end{corollary}
