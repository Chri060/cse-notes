\section{Cost}

In addition to performance considerations, hardware also incurs a cost, which reflects the expenditure incurred by the manufacturer to produce a finished product.

High volume production entails several benefits, including a faster learning curve, increased manufacturing efficiency (with a potential 10\% reduction in cost if volume doubles), and decreased research and development cost per unit produced.

Commodities refer to identical products offered by numerous vendors in substantial quantities. 
These products are characterized by their low-cost due to the high volume of production and competition among suppliers.
