    The course topics are: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Review of basic computer architecture: the RISC approach and pipelining, the memory hierarchy.
        \item Basic performance evaluation metrics of computer architectures.
        \item Techniques for performance optimization: processor and memory.
        \item Instruction level parallelism: static and dynamic scheduling; superscalar architectures: principles and problems; VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) architectures, examples of architecture families.
        \item Thread-level parallelism.
        \item Multiprocessors and multicore systems: taxonomy, topologies, communication management, memory management, cache coherency protocols, example of architectures.
        \item Stream processors and vector processors; Graphic Processors, GP-GPUs, heterogeneous architectures.
