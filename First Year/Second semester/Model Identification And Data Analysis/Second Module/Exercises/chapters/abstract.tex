    The course topics are: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Non-parametric system identification: the subspace-based state-space approach
        \item Kalman Filter: prediction, virtual-sensing and gray-box system identification
        \item Analysis and design of closed-loop systems using the minimum-variance approach
        \item Non-linear system-identification: parametric nonlinear fitting; N-ARMAX models; optimal design of basis functions using Principal-Component-Analysis
        \item Frequency-domany parametric estimation of models from data
        \item Recursive system identification: extension of system-identification to time-varying systems
    \end{itemize}
