	The course encompasses a diverse array of topics, including non-parametric system identification utilizing the subspace-based state-space approach, Kalman Filter applications for prediction, virtual-sensing, and gray-box system identification. 
	It also covers the analysis and design of closed-loop systems using the minimum-variance approach, as well as non-linear system identification involving parametric nonlinear fitting, NARMAX models, and the optimal design of basis functions using principal component analysis. 
	Furthermore, the course includes frequency-domain parametric estimation of models from data and extends into recursive system identification, which broadens the scope to encompass time-varying systems.
