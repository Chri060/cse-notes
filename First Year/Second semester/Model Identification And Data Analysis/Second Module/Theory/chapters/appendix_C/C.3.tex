\section{Discretization of the time derivative}

The discretization techniques employed in this context include the Euler backward method:
\[\dot{x}\approx \dfrac{x(t)-x(t-1)}{\Delta T}=\dfrac{x(t)-x(t)z^{-1}}{\Delta T}=\dfrac{z-1}{z\Delta T}x(t)\]
and the Euler forward method:
\[\dot{x}\approx \dfrac{x(t+1)-x(t)}{\Delta T}=\dfrac{x(t)z-x(t)}{\Delta T}=\dfrac{z-1}{\Delta T}x(t)\]
The general formula is a convex combination of Euler forward and Euler backward methods:
\[\dot{x}\approx \left[\dfrac{z-1}{\Delta T}\dfrac{1}{\alpha z + (1-\alpha)}\right]x(t) \]
where  $0 \leq\alpha\leq 1$. 

A commonly utilized special case is when $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$. 
In this instance, it is referred to as the Tustin discretization method.
