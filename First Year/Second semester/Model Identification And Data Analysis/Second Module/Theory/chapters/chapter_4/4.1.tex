\section{Introduction}

We've successfully tackled software sensing using the Kalman Filter.
The key characteristics of the Kalman Filter include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It necessitates a white-box model of the system.
    \item While theoretically a training dataset isn't required, practical tuning $v_1$ and $v_2$ often involves experimentation and data.
    \item It operates as a constructive method built upon a feedback correction framework.
    \item Theoretically, it can estimate states that are entirely unmeasurable.
\end{itemize}
Alternatively, the same software sensing problem can be approached using a black-box methodology, by redefining the problem as a black-box system identification challenge.
