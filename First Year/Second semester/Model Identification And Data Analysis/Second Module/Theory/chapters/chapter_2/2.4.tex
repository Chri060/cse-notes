\section{Performance index selection}

Our chosen performance index operates in the frequency domain and is computed as follows:
\[J_M(\vartheta)=\dfrac{1}{H}\sum_{i=1}^{H}\left(\left\lvert W(e^{j\omega_i},\vartheta)-\dfrac{\hat{B}_i}{A_i}e^{j\hat{\varphi}_i}\right\rvert^2 \right)\]
This index evaluates the discrepancy between the transfer function $W(e^{j\omega_i},\vartheta)$ and the estimated frequency response $\frac{\hat{B}_i}{A_i}e^{j\hat{\varphi}_i}$ across the range of frequencies considered.
