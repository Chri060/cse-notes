\section{Exercise two}

Consider the system: 
\[\mathcal{S}:y(t)=e(t)+\dfrac{1}{2}e(t-1)\qquad e(t)\sim WN(0,1)\]
And the model: 
\[\mathcal{M}:y(t)=\eta(t)+b\eta(t-1)\qquad \eta(t)\sim WN(0,\lambda^2)\]
Find the value of $b^\ast$ and $\lambda^{\ast 2}$. 

\subsection*{Solution}
Since both the model and the system are of the same type (Moving Average of order one), we can conclude that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $b^\ast=\frac{1}{2}$. 
    \item $\lambda^{\ast 2}=1$. 
\end{itemize}
Thus, we obtain the same formulation for the system.
The model is stable since the poles are inside the unit circle.
