\section{Exercise two}

Consider the system: 
\[\mathcal{S}:y(t)=e(t)+\dfrac{1}{2}e(t-1)\qquad e(t)\sim WN(0,1)\]
And the model used is: 
\[\mathcal{M}:y(t)=\eta(t)+b\eta(t-1)\qquad \eta(t)\sim WN(0,\lambda^2)\]
Find the value of $\theta^\ast=b$ and $\lambda^2$. 

\subsection{Solution}
Since both model and system are of the same type (Moving Average of order one) we can say that: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\theta^\ast=\frac{1}{2}$. 
    \item $\lambda^2=1$. 
\end{itemize}
And we obtain the same formulation of the system.
