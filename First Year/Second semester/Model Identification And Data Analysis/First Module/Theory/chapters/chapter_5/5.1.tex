\section{Introduction}

Let's consider a process with a rational spectrum:
\[v(t)=W(z)\eta(t)=\dfrac{C(z)}{A(z)}\eta(t) \qquad \eta(\cdot)\sim WN(0,\lambda^2)\]
Prediction aims to estimate the future value $v(t+r)$ (with $r>0$) based on observations of the process up to time $t$.
This estimate, denoted as $\hat{v}(t+r|t)$, depends on the predictor horizon $r$. 
Generally, the predictor takes the form:
\[\hat{v}(t+r|t)=f\left( v(t),v(t-1),\dots \right)\]
It's important to note that the prediction error itself is a stochastic process since $\hat{v}(\cdot)$ depends on random variables.
\begin{example}
    A na√Øve predictor could be constructed by averaging the last observed samples:
    \[\hat{v}(t+1|t)=\dfrac{1}{3}v(t)+\dfrac{1}{3}v(t-1)+\dfrac{1}{3}v(t-2)\]
\end{example}
Our goal is to find the optimal predictor that effectively combines information from the model and the available past observations.
