\section{Prediction of ARMA processes}

Consider a generic ARMA process represented as:
\[A(z)v(t)=C(z)\eta(t) \quad \eta(\cdot)\sim WN(0,\lambda^2)\]
Here, $A(z)$ and $C(z)$ are monic polynomials of the same degree. 
Assuming all their roots lie within the unit circle, and they share no common roots, this representation is considered canonical.

To derive the one-step ahead predictor, we employ a single step of the long division procedure on the transfer function. 
Consequently, the optimal one-step ahead predictor is characterized by the transfer function:
\[W_1(z)=\dfrac{z\left( C(z)-A(z) \right)}{C(z)}\]
This corresponds to the following time-domain equation:
\[C(z)\hat{v}(t+1|t)=z\left( C(z)-A(z) \right)v(t)=\left( C(z)-A(z) \right)v(t+1)\]
