\section{NARMAX process}

Nonlinear ARMAX models are characterized by the expression:
\[y(t)=f\left(y(t-1),\dots,y(t-m),e(t-1),\dots,e(t-n),u(t-k),\dots,u(t-k-p)\right)\]
Here, $f$ represents a nonlinear and parametric function. 
Commonly utilized functions in this type of models include: polynomials, splines, wavelets, neural networks, and radian basis functions.
