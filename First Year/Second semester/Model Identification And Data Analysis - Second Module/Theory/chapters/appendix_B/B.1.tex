\section{Definition}

\begin{definition}[\textit{Unitary matrix}]
    A matrix is termed unitary if it satisfies two conditions:
\end{definition}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Its determinant is one.
    \item Its inverse is equal to its transpose.
\end{enumerate}

This means that multiplying a unitary matrix by its transpose should yield the identity matrix.
