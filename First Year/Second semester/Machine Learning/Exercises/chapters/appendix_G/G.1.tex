\section{Introduction}

Our objective is to capture the dynamics of a process and explore the ability to make choices among various actions in each scenario. 
We address two distinct but interconnected challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Prediction}: given a predefined behavior (policy) for each scenario, our aim is to forecast the anticipated long-term reward from a given initial state.
\item \textit{Control}: our focus shifts to learning the optimal course of action to maximize the expected long-term reward derived from the underlying process.
\end{itemize}
