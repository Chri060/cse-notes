\section{Multiple classes}

If we're dealing with multiple classes, we can utilize the same function by providing a target with more than two labels. 
This approach involves training $k$ different models, each distinguishing one class from the rest. 
In this scenario, the parameter vector becomes a matrix $W$.

Although we can still visualize the separating surfaces, it becomes slightly more challenging compared to the binary classification case. 
However, extending these methods to handle multiple classes doesn't require any changes.
