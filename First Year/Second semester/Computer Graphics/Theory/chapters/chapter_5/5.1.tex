\section{Introduction}

Four techniques employed in real-time computer graphics to tackle specific optimization and visualization challenges include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Back-face culling.
    \item Depth testing (and stencil buffer).
    \item Clipping.
    \item Screen update synchronization.
\end{itemize}
Each of these techniques can be fine-tuned and configured within Vulkan, influencing various aspects of the visualization process.
