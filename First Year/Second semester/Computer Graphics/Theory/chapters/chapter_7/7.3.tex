\section{Point light model}

Point lights are light sources that emit light from fixed positions in space and do not have a specific direction. 
Unlike directional lights, which emit light uniformly in a particular direction from a distant source, point lights radiate light equally in all directions from a single point in space. 
They are commonly used to simulate light sources such as lamps or bulbs, where light emanates spherically in all directions from a specific location.
