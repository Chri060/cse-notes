\section{Exercise 1}

A new malware just broke out, causing a world-wide infection and a huge amount of damages. 
Unfortunately, all the anti-malware systems are not able to detect this malware. 
You were able to retrieve a couple of samples.
Consider the code snippets reported below, extracted from the two malware samples you retrieved:
\begin{verbatim}
pop ebx
lea ecx, [ebx + 42h]
push ecx
push eax
push eax
sdt [esp - 02h]
pop ebx
add ebx, 1Ch
cli
mov ebp, [ebx]
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
pop ebx
lea ecx, [ebx + 42h]
push ecx
push eax
nop
push eax
inc eax
sdt [esp - 02h]
dec eax
pop ebx
add ebx, 1Ch
cli
mov ebp, [ebx]
\end{verbatim}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is clear that the malware is showing evasive behavior. 
        What technique is implemented?
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If there is no packing like in this case we have metamorphism. 
        The idea of this malware is to add useless instruction to change the dimension of the code but not the way it works. 
\end{enumerate}
