\section{Exercise one}
Translate the given C code into assembly x86. 
\begin{verbatim}
if (c == 0)
    a = b;
else
    a = -b;
\end{verbatim}
Assume $b$ is stored in EBX, $c$ is stored in ECX, and $a$ is stored in EAX.

\subsection{Solution}
The equivalent assembly code for the C program is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
    mov edx, 0
    cmp ecx, edx
    jne ELSE
    mov eax, ebx
    jmp ENDIF
ELSE:
    mov eax, 0
    sub eax, ebx
ENDIF:
    nop
\end{verbatim}
