\section{Exercise 3}

A network analyst is analyzing some traffic captured from a network belonging to Politecnico di Milano. 
The network is: 131.175.0.0/16. 
In particular, we suspect that a database server, whose IP address is 131.175.14.12, is victim of an attack. 
Indeed, observing the network traffic, we notice the following pattern:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 131.175.14.12 $\rightarrow$ 131.175.255.255 [ICMP] Echo (ping) request (broadcast)
    \item 131.175.0.2 $\rightarrow$ 131.175.14.12 [ICMP] Echo (ping) reply
    \item 7a:ce:29 $\rightarrow$ ff:ff:ff (broadcast) [ARP] Who has 131.175.14.12? Tell 131.175.0.2
    \item 4b:74:28 $\rightarrow$ 7a:ce:29 [ARP] 131.175.14.12 is at 4b:74:28
    \item 131.175.0.3 $\rightarrow$ 131.175.14.12 [ICMP] Echo (ping) reply
    \item 131.175.0.4 $\rightarrow$ 131.175.14.12 [ICMP] Echo (ping) reply $\vdots$
    \item 131.175.255.251 $\rightarrow$ 131.175.14.12 [ICMP] Echo (ping) reply
    \item 131.175.255.252 $\rightarrow$ 131.175.14.12 [ICMP] Echo (ping) reply
    \item 131.175.255.253 $\rightarrow$ 131.175.14.12 [ICMP] Echo (ping) reply
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe what attack you think is going on, and what is the feature (or lack thereof) of the involved protocol(s) that enable this attack.
    \item Describe what you think is the concrete goal(s) of the attack in this scenario. 
    \item Can you tell the IP and MAC address of the attacker? Why?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item PING Smurf. 
    \item The goal is to saturate the resources of the victim using other machines on the network as an amplification mean. 
        This results in a denial of service. 
    \item No, the IP address is spoofed for sure, and the MAC address can be spoofed as well.
\end{enumerate}
