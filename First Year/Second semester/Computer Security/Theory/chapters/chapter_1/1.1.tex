\section{Basic security requirements}

The fundamental security principles, known as the CIA paradigm for information security, outline three key requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Confidentiality}: only authorized entities can access information.
    \item \textit{Integrity}: information can only be modified by authorized entities in authorized ways.
    \item \textit{Availability}: information must be accessible to all authorized parties within specified time limits.
\end{itemize}
It's worth noting that the availability requirement can sometimes conflict with the other two, as higher availability exposes the system for longer durations.
