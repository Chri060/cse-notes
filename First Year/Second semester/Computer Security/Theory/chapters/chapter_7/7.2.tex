\section{Macro viruses}

Traditionally, data files were considered safe from viruses. 
However, the advent of macro functionalities introduced a new threat by allowing code to be embedded within these files. 
For example, spreadsheet macros can perform various actions such as modifying a spreadsheet, altering other spreadsheets, accessing the address book, and even sending emails. 
One notable and successful instance of this type of virus is the Melissa virus, which proved to be particularly difficult to remove.
