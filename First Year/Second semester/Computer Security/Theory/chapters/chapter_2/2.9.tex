\section{State of the art}

The contemporary secure communication protocols such as TLS, OpenVPN, and IPSec utilizes the following structure:

\paragraph*{Quantum computers}
With quantum computing some computationally challenging problems will become less hard, prompting a reassessment of their difficulty. 
There's a notable shift away from cryptosystems built upon factoring and discrete logarithm. 

\paragraph*{Compute on encrypted data}
Performing computations on encrypted data is feasible; however, it tends to be moderately to severely inefficient.

\paragraph*{Physical access}
If the attacker gains physical access to the device executing the cipher (or can remotely measure it), it is essential to consider side-channel information within the attacker model.
