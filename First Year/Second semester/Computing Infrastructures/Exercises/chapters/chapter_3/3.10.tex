\section{Exercise ten}

In the context of monitoring a single-class interactive system, the following data is observed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Disk demand: 4 seconds per transaction.
    \item CPU demand: 1 second per transaction.
    \item CPU utilization: 80\%.
    \item Response time: 20 seconds per transaction.
    \item Monitoring period: 6 minutes.
    \item Number of users: 16.
\end{itemize}
Compute what is the average think time for these users. 

\subsection*{Solution}
Given:
\[D_d=4 \qquad D_c=1 \qquad U_c=0.8 \qquad R=20 \qquad T=6 \qquad N=16\]
We can calculate the average think time using the response time law, but first, we need to find the throughput:
\[X=\dfrac{U_c}{D_c}=\dfrac{0.8}{1}=0.8\:\dfrac{\text{transaction}}{\text{sec}}\]
Therefore, the average think time is:
\[Z=\dfrac{N}{X}-R=\dfrac{16}{0.8}-20=0\text{ s}\]
