\section{Exercise seventeen}

The throughput of a disk is 100 I/O operations per second.
To complete a given request, 20 visits to the disk are required. 
There are 100 users, and the response time is 15 seconds. 
Compute the users' think time.

\subsection*{Solution}
The throughput of the system is:
\[X=\dfrac{X_D}{V_D}=\dfrac{100}{20}=5\:\dfrac{\text{op}}{{\text{sec}}}\]
Finally, the think time can be computed with the response time law:
\[Z=\dfrac{N}{X}-R=\dfrac{100}{5}-15=5\text{ s}\]
