\section{Exercise five}

In a course, there are 100 students. 
Each student studies for a week, then sends an email to the professor, waits for an answer, studies one more week, and then sends another email, and so on. 
The professor replies to 5 emails every day. 
Compute how much time does every student wait, on average, for an answer.

\subsection*{Solution}
Given:
\[N=100\qquad Z=7\qquad X=5\]
Average time for a response:
\[R=\dfrac{N}{X}-Z=\dfrac{100}{5}-7=13\text{ days}\]
