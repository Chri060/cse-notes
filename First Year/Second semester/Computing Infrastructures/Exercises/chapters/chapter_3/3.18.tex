\section{Exercise eighteen}

A web server of a company is connected to an intranet and is accessed by the employees who work internally in the company, resulting in a fixed-size population of $N=21$ users.
The average think time of the users is $Z=20\text{ s}$. 
A complete execution of a request generates a load of $V_s=20$ operations to a specific storage device whose utilization is $U_s = 0.30$. 
The service time of the storage device per each visit is $S_s = 0.025\text{ s}$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine the average system response time.
    \item Compute the average throughput and system response time with $N=40$ users.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The throughput of the system is:
        \[X=\dfrac{U_S}{V_S}=\dfrac{0.3}{20\cdot 0.025}=0.6\:\dfrac{\text{op}}{{\text{sec}}}\]
        Finally, the system response time can be computed with the response time law:
        \[R=\dfrac{N}{X}-Z=\dfrac{21}{0.6}-20=15\text{ s}\]
    \item We cannot determine the average throughput and system response time for $N=40$ with the provided information.
\end{enumerate}
