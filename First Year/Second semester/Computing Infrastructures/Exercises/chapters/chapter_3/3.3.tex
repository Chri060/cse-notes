\section{Exercise three}

The busy time of a virtual machine is 3 hours every 4 hours. 
Its utilization is 80\%, and on average, it is serving 5 jobs simultaneously. 
Determine:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system throughput.
    \item The average response time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}
Given:
\[B=3\qquad T=4\qquad U=0.8 \qquad N=5\]
The utilization calculated from busy time and total time does not match the given utilization:
\[U=\dfrac{B}{T}=\dfrac{3}{4}=0.75\neq 0.8\]
The given data is inconsistent; therefore, this exercise cannot be solved.
