\section{Exercise four}

The busy time of a virtual machine is 3 hours every 4 hours. 
In that time, it has completed 15 jobs, and on average, it is serving 5 jobs simultaneously. 
Determine:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system throughput.
    \item The average response time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Solution}
Given: 
\[B=3\qquad T=4\qquad C=15 \qquad N=5\]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given:
        \[X=\dfrac{C}{T}=\dfrac{15}{4}=3.75\:\dfrac{\text{jobs}}{\text{hour}}\]
    \item Average Response Time:
        \[R=\dfrac{N}{X}=\dfrac{5}{3.75}=80\text{ min}\]
\end{enumerate}
