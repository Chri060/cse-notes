\section{Exercise sixteen}

The storage server of an intranet comprises two groups of disks, A and B, each with service time means $S_A=5\text{ ms}$ and $S_B=3\text{ ms}$, respectively.
The mean number of visits for the two components are $V_A = 20$ and $V_B = 30$. 
The throughput of A is 150 operations per second. 
These data were collected when the system was processing a workload generated by 300 users with a think time of $Z=15\text{ s}$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Calculate the system throughput $X$ and the Utilization of B.
    \item Determine the system response time.
    \item Assume that the number of users increases to 400, compute the new response time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For the system throughput, we need the utilization and the mean service time of A:
        \[U_A=X_A\cdot S_A=0.005 \cdot 150=0.75\]
        \[D_A=V_A\cdot S_A=20 \cdot 5=100\:\text{ms}\]
        At this point, the system throughput is:
        \[X=\dfrac{U_A}{D_A}=\dfrac{0.75}{100}=7.5\:\dfrac{\text{op}}{\text{sec}}\]
        The utilization of B is:
        \[U_B=X\cdot D_B=X\cdot(S_B\cdot V_B)=D_B=7.5\cdot(3\cdot 30)=0.675\]
    \item The system response time can be computed with the response time law:
        \[R=\dfrac{N}{X}-Z=\dfrac{300}{7.5}-15=20\text{ s}\]
    \item We cannot determine the new response time for $N=400$ with the provided information.
\end{enumerate}
