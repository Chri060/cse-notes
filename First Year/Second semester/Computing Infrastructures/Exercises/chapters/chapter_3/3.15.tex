\section{Exercise fifteen}

In a batch system, a specific disk performs, on average, 12 operations per second. 
Each batch transaction requires, on average, 6 accesses to this disk. 
Another disk in the system handles 18 operations per second.
Compute the average number of accesses to this second disk required by every batch transaction.

\subsection*{Solution}
Given:
\[X_D=12 \qquad V_{D1}=6\qquad X_{D2}=18\]
The average number of accesses to the second disk per batch transaction is:
\[V_{D2}=\dfrac{X_{D2}}{X}=\dfrac{X_{D2}}{\frac{X_{D1}}{V_{D1}}}=\dfrac{18}{\frac{12}{6}}=9\]
