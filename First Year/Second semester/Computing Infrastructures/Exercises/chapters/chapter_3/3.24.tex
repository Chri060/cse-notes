\section{Exercise twenty-four}

Consider a session of a graphical multi-user workstation that utilizes a disk with an average service time of $S_{\text{disk}}=25$ ms. 
The following measurements are obtained:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Average think-time: $Z=10$ s.
    \item Average CPU service demand: $D_{\text{CPU}}=4$ s.
    \item Average disk service demand: $D_{\text{disk}}=5$ s.
    \item Fraction of the busy time in which the CPU performs floating-point operations: $75\%$.
\end{itemize}
Using asymptotic bounds, determine which of the following modifications is more advantageous:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Adding a floating-point unit (FPU) that is 10 times as fast as the CPU to offload floating-point operations.
    \item Replacing the disk with a new one with $S^\prime_{\text{disk}}=15$ ms.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}
The bottleneck of the system is the disk; replacing the CPU will have marginal effects. 
Therefore, the best solution is to replace the disk.
