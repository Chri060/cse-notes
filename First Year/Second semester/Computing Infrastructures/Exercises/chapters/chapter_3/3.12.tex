\section{Exercise twelve}

At a ski resort, there are 1000 visitors per day. 
On average, each skier visits the resort's main ski slope 10 times. 
Compute how many visits does the slope receive in a day. 

\subsection*{Solution}
Given:
\[x=1000\qquad V_{\text{slope}}=10\]
We can find the total visits to the slope per day as:
\[X_{\text{slope}}=V_{\text{slope}}\cdot X=10 \cdot 1000=10000\:\dfrac{\text{visits}}{\text{day}}\]
