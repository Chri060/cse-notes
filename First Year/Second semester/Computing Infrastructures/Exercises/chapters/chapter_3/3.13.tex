\section{Exercise thirteen}

In an interactive system with 80 active terminals, the average think time is 12 seconds per interaction. 
On average, each interaction results in 15 paging disk accesses. 
Assume that the service time per paging disk access is 30 ms and the disk is 60\% busy, compute what is the average system response time.

\subsection*{Solution}
Given:
\[N=80\qquad Z=12 \qquad V_{\text{disk}}=15 \qquad S_{\text{disk}}=30\qquad S_{\text{disks}}=0.6\]
To find the average system response time, we need to determine $X$ and $X_{\text{disk}}$. 
Using the utilization law for disks:
\[X_{\text{disk}}=\dfrac{U_{\text{disk}}}{S_{\text{disk}}}=\dfrac{0.6}{0.03}=20\:\dfrac{\text{req}}{\text{sec}}\]
Then, the overall system throughput is:
\[X=\dfrac{X_{\text{disk}}}{V_{\text{disk}}}=\dfrac{20}{15}=1.3\:\dfrac{\text{req}}{\text{sec}}\]
Finally, applying the response time law:
\[R=\dfrac{N}{X}-Z=\dfrac{80}{1.3}-12=48\text{ s}\]
