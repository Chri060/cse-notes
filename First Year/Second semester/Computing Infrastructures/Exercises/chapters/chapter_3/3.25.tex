\section{Exercise twenty-five}

Let's examine a batch system featuring one CPU and two disks, with the following measurements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Monitoring period: 500 seconds.
    \item CPU busy time: 144 seconds.
    \item CPU completed operations: 200.
    \item Slow disk busy time: 86 seconds.
    \item Slow disk completed operations: 100.
    \item Fast disk busy time: 226 seconds.
    \item Fast disk completed operations: 500.
    \item Completed transactions: 200.
    \item Number of concurrent jobs: 2.
\end{itemize}
We aim to balance the load between the two disks by shifting files to increase the expected maximum throughput. 
After redistributing the files, what is the maximum throughput for the new system, according to asymptotic bounds? Integer values for visits are not required.

\subsection*{Solution}
Based on the provided metrics, we derive the following calculations:
\begin{align*}
    D_{\text{slow}} & = \frac{B_{\text{slow}}}{C} = 0.43 \\
    D_{\text{fast}} & = \frac{B_{\text{fast}}}{C} = 1.13 \\
    V_{\text{fast}} & = \frac{C_{\text{fast}}}{C} = 2.5 \\
    V_{\text{slow}} & = \frac{C_{\text{slow}}}{C} = 0.5 \\
    V_{\text{bal}} & = V_{\text{fast}} + V_{\text{slow}} = 3 \\
    S_{\text{fast}} & = \frac{D_{\text{fast}}}{\sqrt{V_{\text{fast}}}} = 0.45200 \\
    S_{\text{slow}} & = \frac{D_{\text{slow}}}{\sqrt{V_{\text{slow}}}} = 0.86000 \\
    D_{\text{cpu}} & = \frac{B_{\text{cpu}}}{C} = 0.72 \\
    D_{\text{bal}} & = \frac{V_{\text{bal}}}{(1/S_{\text{slow}} + 1/S_{\text{fast}})} = 0.88884 \\
    D_{\text{tot}} & = 2 \times D_{\text{bal}} + D_{\text{cpu}} = 2.49768 \\
    D_{\text{max}_b} & = \max\left(D_{\text{bal}}, D_{\text{cpu}}\right) = 0.88884 \\
    X_{\text{max}_h} & = \min\left(\frac{1}{D_{\text{maxb}}}, N \times D_{\text{tot}}\right) = 0.80074
\end{align*}
