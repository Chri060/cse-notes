\section{Exercise fourteen}

During a 30-minute observation interval, a specific disk was found to be busy for 12 minutes. 
It's known that jobs typically require 320 accesses to that disk, with an average service time per access of 25 milliseconds. 
Compute the system throughput (in jobs per second). 

\subsection*{Solution}
Given:
\[T=30 \qquad B_d=12 \qquad V_d=320 \qquad S_d=25\]
The throughput can be computed directly as:
\[X=\dfrac{U_d}{D_d}=\dfrac{\frac{B_d}{T}}{V_d\cdot S_d}=\dfrac{\frac{12}{30}}{320\cdot 0.025}=0.05\:\dfrac{\text{req}}{\text{sec}}\]

Alternatively, we have$X_d=\frac{U_d}{S_d}$, thus: 
\[X=\dfrac{X_d}{V_d}=\dfrac{\frac{U_d}{S_d}}{V_d}=\dfrac{U_d}{V_d\cdot S_d}=0.05\:\dfrac{\text{req}}{\text{sec}}\]
