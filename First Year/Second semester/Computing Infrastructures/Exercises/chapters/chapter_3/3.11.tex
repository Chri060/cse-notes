\section{Exercise eleven}

Here are the measurement data for an interactive system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Measurement interval: 2 minutes.
    \item Number of users: 15.
    \item Average response time per transaction: 10 seconds.
    \item Disk demand: 0.5 seconds per transaction.
    \item CPU demand: 0.2 seconds per transaction.
    \item Number of servers: 20.
    \item Number of completed transactions: 60.
\end{itemize}
Compute the average number of users who are thinking. 

\subsection*{Solution}
We know that the total number of users is given by:
\[N=N^{\prime}_{\text{think}}+N^{\prime\prime}_{\text{in}}\]
To find the number of thinking users, we first need to find the number of users in the system since $N$ is given. 
We can find the system throughput as:
\[X=\dfrac{C}{T}=\dfrac{C}{T}=\dfrac{60}{120}=0.5\:\dfrac{\text{transactions}}{\text{sec}}\]
Utilizing Little's law:
\[N^{\prime\prime}=XR=0.5\cdot 10=5\]
Therefore, the number of users thinking is:
\[N^{\prime}=N-N^{\prime\prime}=15-5=10\]
