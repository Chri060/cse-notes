\section{Exercise six}

In the C-5 aircraft, there are 12 identical AC generators, and at least 9 of them must be operational for the aircraft to complete its mission. 
Failures follow an exponential distribution with a failure rate of $0.01$ failure per hour.
Compute the reliability of the generator system over a ten-hour mission in case the switch is perfect.

\subsection*{Solution}
For a system composed of $n$ identical replicas where at least $r$ replicas must function for the entire system to operate correctly, the system reliability is given by:
\[R_s(t)=R_V\sum_{i=r}^{n}R_c^i(1-R_c)^{n-1}\binom{n}{i} \]
Here: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $R_s$ is the system reliability. 
    \item $R_c$ is the component reliability. 
    \item $R_v$ is the voter reliability. 
    \item $n$ is the number of components. 
    \item $r$ is the minimum number of components that must function.
\end{itemize}

For each generator over a ten-hour mission, the reliability is:
\[R_m(10)=e^{-\lambda t}=e^{-0.01\cdot 10}=0.9048374\]

Substituting into the formula, we get:
\[R_s=\sum_{i=9}^12R_m^i\left(1-R_m\right)^{12-i}\binom{12}{i}=165R_m^{12}+540 R_m^{11}+549R_m^10 +220 R_m^9 =0.9782773\]
