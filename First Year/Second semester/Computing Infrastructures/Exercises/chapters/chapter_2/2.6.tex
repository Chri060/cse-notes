\section{Exercise six}

A system administrator needs to utilize a stock of disks with the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) of 800 days.
    \item Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) of twenty days.
\end{itemize}
The desired operational lifetime of the system is 3 years.
Calculate the maximum number of disks that can be used in RAID 01 to ensure a mean time to data loss greater than the system's lifetime.

\subsection*{Solution}
We know that:
\[\text{MTTF}_{\text{RAID 01}}=\dfrac{2\cdot \text{MTTF}^2}{N^2\cdot\text{MTTR}}\]
Thus, we have:
\[N=\sqrt{\dfrac{2\cdot\text{MTTF}^2}{\text{MTTF}_{\text{RAID 01}}\cdot\text{MTTR}}}=\sqrt{\dfrac{2\cdot800^2}{20\cdot 3\cdot 365}}\approx 7.65\]
The correct answer is six, as in RAID 01, an even number of disks is needed, which must be less than $N=7.65$.
