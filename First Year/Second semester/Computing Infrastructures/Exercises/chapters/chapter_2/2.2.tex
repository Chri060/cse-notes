\section{Exercise two}

Let's analyze the mean time to failure (MTTF) of a RAID 0 setup with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N=5$ disks.
    \item Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) of eight hours.
    \item Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) of one disk is 1600 days.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Solution}
In RAID 0, all elements are in series, so the MTTF of each disk divided by the number of disks equals the MTTF of the RAID 0 setup:
\[\text{MTTF}_{\text{RAID 0}}=\dfrac{\text{MTTF}}{\text{N}}=\dfrac{1600}{5}=320 \text{ days}\]
