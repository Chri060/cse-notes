\section{Exercise three}

Let's calculate the mean time to failure (MTTF) of a RAID 1 setup with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $N=2$ disks.
    \item Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) of eight days.
    \item Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) of one disk is 1800 days.+
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Solution}
The failure rate of the disks is given by:
\[\lambda=\dfrac{N}{\text{MTTF}}=\dfrac{2}{1800}=\dfrac{1}{900}\]
The failure rate of the RAID 1 setup is then:
\[\lambda_{\text{RAID 1}}=\lambda\cdot\left(\dfrac{1}{\text{MTTF}}\cdot\text{MTTR}\right)=\dfrac{2\cdot\text{MTTR}}{\text{MTTF}^2}\]
Therefore, the mean time to failure is:
\[\text{MTTF}_{\text{RAID 1}}=\dfrac{1}{\lambda_{\text{RAID 1}}}=\dfrac{1800^2}{2\cdot8}\]
