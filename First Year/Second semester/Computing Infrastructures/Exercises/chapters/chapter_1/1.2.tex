\section{Exercise two}

Let's consider a generic component D. 
We are tasked with determining the minimum integer value for the mean time to failure of D to ensure that $R_{\text{D}}(t) \geq 0.96$ at five days.

\subsection*{Solution}
The reliability is defined as:
\[R(t)=e^{-\lambda t}=e^{-\frac{t}{\text{MTTF}}}\]
We need to satisfy:
\[R_{\text{D}}(5)\geq 0.96\]
Which is equivalent to:
\[e^{-\frac{5 \text{days}}{\text{MTTF}}}\geq 0.96\]
Thus, we have:
\[\rightarrow \text{MTTF}\geq -\frac{5 \text{days}}{\ln(0.96)}\rightarrow \text{MTTF}\geq 122.5 \text{ days}\]
Therefore, the minimum mean time to failure required to meet the given conditions is $122.5$ days.
