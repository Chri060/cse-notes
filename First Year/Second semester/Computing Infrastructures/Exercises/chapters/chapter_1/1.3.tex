\section{Exercise three}

A smartphone manufacturer determines that their products have a mean time to failure of 59 years in normal use.
They want to estimate how long a warranty should be set if no more than $5\%$ of the items are to be returned for repair.

\subsection*{Solution}
We seek a time $t_w$ such that:
\[1-R(t_w)=0.05\rightarrow R(t_w)=0.95\]
Given the mean time to failure, we can express the reliability as:
\[R(t)=e^{-\lambda t}\rightarrow e^{-\frac{t}{\text{MTTF}}}\]
Substituting, we get:
\[R(t_w)=e^{-\frac{t_w}{\text{MTTF}}}=0.95\rightarrow t_w=-59\ln(0.95)=3.026 \text{ years}\]
Hence, the warranty should be set for approximately 3 years to ensure that no more than $5\%$ of the items are returned for repair.
