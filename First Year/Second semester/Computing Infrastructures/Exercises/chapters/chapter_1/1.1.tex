\section{Exercise one}

A pacemaker for the heart has a failure rate of $\lambda = 0.25 \cdot 10^{-8}$ per hour.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the mean time to failure. 
    \item Compute the probability that it fails during the first five years of operation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The average time to failure is calculated as:
        \[\text{MTTF}=\dfrac{1}{\lambda}=\dfrac{1}{0.25 \cdot 10^{-8}}=4\cdot 10^8\text{ hours}\approx 45.662\text{ years}\]
        Hence, the average time to failure of the heart pacemaker is approximately $45.6\text{ years}$. 
    \item The reliability of the system can be expressed as:
        \[R(t)=e^{-\lambda t}\]
        Given $\lambda$ as specified and a duration of five years, we have:
        \[R(5)=e^{-5\lambda}=e^{-1.25\cdot 10^{-8}}=0.9999999875\]
        Subsequently, the probability of failure during the initial five years of operation is calculated as:
        \[F(5)=1-R(5)=1-0.9999999875=1.25 \cdot 10^{-8}\]
\end{enumerate}
