\section{Introduction}

Cloud Computing represents a broad, scalable network of computing, storage, and networking resources readily available to the public. 
Users can access these resources via web service calls over the Internet, enabling both short-term and long-term usage based on a pay-per-use model.

\subsection{Virtualization}
Virtualization entails dividing and sharing hardware resources such as CPUs and RAM among multiple Virtual Machines (VMs). 
A Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) manages the allocation of these physical resources to the VMs, ensuring performance isolation and security.

Without virtualization, software is tightly coupled with specific hardware, complicating the process of moving or modifying applications.
In such environments, failures or crashes are confined to individual servers, operating systems (OS), and applications, leading to low CPU utilization.
Virtualization decouples software from hardware, providing greater flexibility through pre-configured VMs. 
OS and applications can be managed as unified entities, simplifying deployment and management.
Virtualization has significantly influenced the evolution of IT systems, particularly through server consolidation and the facilitation of Cloud Computing.

\paragraph*{Server consolidation}
Server consolidation involves transitioning from physical to VMs.
This approach enables the seamless movement of VMs without disrupting the applications running within them. 
Workloads can be automatically balanced according to predefined limits and guarantees, optimizing resource utilization and safeguarding servers and applications from component and system failures. 
The benefits of server consolidation include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Running multiple OS instances on the same hardware.
    \item Reducing hardware requirements, leading to cost savings in acquisition and management, and promoting environmentally friendly practices (green IT).
    \item Allowing the continued use of legacy software.
    \item Ensuring application independence from underlying hardware.
\end{itemize}
