    This course covers several key topics related to datacenters. 
    The hardware infrastructure section includes discussions on the basic components and rack structure, cooling mechanisms, Hard Disk Drives and Solid State Disks, RAID architectures, and hardware accelerators. 
    The software infrastructure segment explores virtualization concepts and technologies, hypervisors, and containers, as well as the computing architectures of cloud, edge, and fog computing, and the different models of service delivery such as infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and software-as-a-service. 
    Additionally, the course delves into methods for assessing scalability and performance in datacenters, including definitions, fundamental laws, and basics of queuing network theory, as well as reliability and availability, covering definitions, fundamental laws, and reliability block diagrams.
