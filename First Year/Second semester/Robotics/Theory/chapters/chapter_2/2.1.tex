\section{Introduction}

Sensors serve to detect both the internal condition of the robot (proprioceptive sensors) and the external state of the environment (exteroceptive sensors).
Another classification for sensors can be based on whether they are passive, which measure physical properties, or active, which involve an emitter and a detector.

Effectors are responsible for altering the state of the environment, with actuators facilitating the actions of effectors.
