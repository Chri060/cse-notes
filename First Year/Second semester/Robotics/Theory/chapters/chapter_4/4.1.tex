\section{Introduction}

Given a map, our objective is to determine the precise location of a robot within that map.
This problem can be addressed by leveraging a sensor model, which characterizes $\text{P}(z|x)$, representing the probability of obtaining a measurement $z$ when the robot is positioned at $x$.
Specifically, a scan $z$ comprises $K$ measurements:
\[z=\left\{ z_1,z_2,\dots,z_K \right\}\]
Each individual measurement is statistically independent, conditioned on the robot's position and the surrounding map:
\[\text{P}(z|x,m)=\prod_{k=1}^{K}\text{P}(z_k|x,m)\]
Measurements may originate from various sources:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Beams reflected by obstacles.
    \item Beams reflected by individuals or influenced by crosstalk.
    \item Random measurements.
    \item Maximum range measurements.
\end{itemize}
