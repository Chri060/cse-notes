\section{Latched messages}
In ROS, latched messages provide a mechanism where subscribers receive the last published message upon subscribing, particularly useful for low-frequency publishers such as maps.
To implement this in code, when creating a publisher, set the third argument to true:
\begin{verbatim}
ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>("chatter", 1, true);
\end{verbatim}
With this configuration, subscribers don't need to wait for new published messages; they immediately receive the last published message upon subscription.
