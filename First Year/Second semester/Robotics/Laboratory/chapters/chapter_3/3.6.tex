\section{Project compilation}

To compile the file, ensure you're located within the directory \texttt{catkin\_ws} and execute \texttt{catkin\_make}. 
Upon successful completion, verify the presence of a folder named \texttt{build}. 
Afterwards, initiate the nodes with the following command:
\begin{verbatim}
rosurun \package_name \node_name
\end{verbatim}

To initiate a package, the \texttt{launch} file within the launch directory is utilized. 
The format of this file follows:
\begin{verbatim}
<launch>
 <group ns="group_name">
    <node pkg="package_name" name="initial_name" type="node_name"/>
 </group>
</launch>
\end{verbatim}
To execute this file, the command employed is:
\begin{verbatim}
roslaunch file_name.launch
\end{verbatim}
