\section{Elicitation of requirements}

The complexity in requirement engineering can be managed through various means, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Employing diverse approaches and strategies, and synthesizing the outcomes from each.
    \item Maintaining proximity to stakeholders.
    \item Enabling stakeholders to articulate their perspectives.
\end{itemize}
This scenario can be generalized in terms of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Involving participation actors.
    \item Defining entry conditions.
    \item Outlining the flow of events.
    \item Specifying exit conditions.
    \item Identifying exceptional cases.
    \item Documenting special requirements.
\end{itemize}
