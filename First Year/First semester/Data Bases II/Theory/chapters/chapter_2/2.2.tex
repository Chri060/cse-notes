\section{Anomalies in concurrent transactions}

The anomalies resulting from incorrect scheduling include: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Lost updates}: update applied from a state that ignores a preceding update, resulting in the loss of the earlier update.
    \item \textit{Dirty reads}: an uncommitted value is used to update the data.
    \item \textit{Non-repeatable reads}: another transaction updates a previously read value.
    \item \textit{Phantom updates}: another transaction updates data that contributes to a previously valid constraint.
    \item \textit{Phantom inserts}: another transaction inserts data that contributes to a previously read datum.
\end{itemize}
