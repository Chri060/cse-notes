\section{Exercise 5}

Classify the given schedule with respect to CSR and VSR classes:
\[r_1(x) r_2(y) w_3(y) r_5(x) w_5(u) w_3(s) w_2(u) w_3(x) w_1(u) r_4(y) w_5(z) r_5(z) r_2(u) w_2(s)\]

\subsection*{Solution}
To analyze the schedule, we first divide it based on the resources:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x: r_1 \: r_5 \: w_3$
    \item $y: r_2 \: w_3 \: r_4$
    \item $z: w_5 \: r_5$
    \item $s: w_3 \: w_2$
    \item $u: w_5 \: w_2 \: w_1 \: r_2$
\end{itemize}
The conflict graph is constructed based on write-write or write-read relations in the resource groups. 
The nodes are $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, and the arcs are determined by the conflicts. 
As a result we have the following graph:

In this case it is not possible to find a VSR schedule because it is impossible to do so without changing the final write on $s$.
