\section{Exercise 11}

Classify the following schedule with respect to timestamps: 
\[r_4(x) r_2(x) w_4(x) w_2(y) w_4(y) r_3(y) w_3(x) w_4(z) r_3(z) r_6(z) r_8(z) w_6(z) w_9(z) r_5(z) r_{10}(z)\]

\paragraph*{Solution}
We can identify pairs of operations that cause killings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X: r_4 r_2 w_4 w_3$
    \item $Y: w_2 w_4 r_3$
    \item $Z: w_4 r_3 r_6 r_8 w_6 w_9 r_5 r_{10}$
\end{itemize}
On $X$ we have that $w_3$ is too late with respect to $r_4$ and $w_4$. On $Y$ we have that $r_3$ is late with respect to $w_4$. 
On $Z$ we have that $r_3$ is late with respect to $w_4$, $w_6$ with respect to $r_8$, $r_5$ with respect to both $w_6$ and $w_9$. 
So, the schedule is not in TS-mono. 

The schedule is also outside TS-multi, because $w_3(X)$ comes too late ($r_4(X)$ was already given the initial version instead) and also because $w_6(Z)$ is late with respect to $r_8(Z)$. 
The other five reasons were due to reads (that are always accepted in TS-multi).
