\section{Exercise 11}

Classify the following schedule with respect to timestamps: 
\[r_4(x) r_2(x) w_4(x) w_2(y) w_4(y) r_3(y) w_3(x) w_4(z) r_3(z) r_6(z) r_8(z) w_6(z) w_9(z) r_5(z) r_{10}(z)\]

\subsection*{Solution}
We can identify pairs of operations that cause killings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x: r_4 \: r_2 \: w_4 \: w_3$
    \item $y: w_2 \: w_4 \: r_3$
    \item $z: w_4 \: r_3 \: r_6 \: r_8 \: w_6 \: w_9 \: r_5 \: r_{10}$
\end{itemize}
On $x$ we have that $w_3$ is too late with respect to $r_4$ and $w_4$. 
On $y$ we have that $r_3$ is late with respect to $w_4$. 
On $z$ we have that $r_3$ is late with respect to $w_4$, $w_6$ with respect to $r_8$, $r_5$ with respect to both $w_6$ and $w_9$. 
So, the schedule is not in TS-mono. 

The schedule is also outside TS-multi, because $w_3(x)$ comes too late ($r_4(x)$ was already given the initial version instead) and also because $w_6(z)$ is late with respect to $r_8(z)$. 
The other five reasons were due to reads (that are always accepted in TS-multi).
