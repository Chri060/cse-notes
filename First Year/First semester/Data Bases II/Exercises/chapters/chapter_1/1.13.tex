\section{Exercise 13}

Classify the following schedule:
\[r_1(x) w_1(y) w_2(y) w_3(z) r_1(z) w_4(x) r_4(y) w_3(x) r_5(y) w_5(x)\] 

\subsection*{Solution}
First, we check if it is CSR:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x: r_1 \: w_4 \: w_3 \: w_5$
    \item $y: w_1 \: w_2 \: r_4 \: r_5$
    \item $z: w_3 \: r_1$
\end{itemize}
We found a cycle between the nodes three and one, so it is not CSR. 
It is also not VSR. We now check for TS using the same list: we find that $w_4 w_3$ are not in the correct order, so it is not in TS-mono, neither in TS-multi (it is a write that causes the problem).
