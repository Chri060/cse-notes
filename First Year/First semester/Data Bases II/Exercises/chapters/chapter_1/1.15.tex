\section{Exercise 15}

Given the resources above and the following transactions:
\[T_1: r_1(z) w_1(y) w_1(z)\] 
\[T_2: w_2(x) r_2(z)\]
Consider that $T_1$ and $T_2$ can only be scheduled in 10 different ways (two serial, eight interleaved). 
What can be stated about the 2PL-strict compatibility of these schedules? 

\subsection*{Solution}
We note that the only potential conflict is between $w_1(z)$ and $r_2(z)$.
But these are also the last operations of their respective transactions: to check for compatibility, we can always assume that the commit occurs right after the last operation, and that all locks are released in favor of the other one. 
But this argument is independent of the order of the operations, and is therefore valid for all the eight interleaved schedules. So, all the schedules are strict 2PL.
