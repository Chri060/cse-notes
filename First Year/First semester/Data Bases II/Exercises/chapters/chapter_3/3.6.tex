\section{Schedule classification}

Classify the following schedule:
\[r_1(x) r_2(y) w_3(x) r_5(z) w_6(z) w_2(x) w_3(y) r_7(z) w_4(x)\] 

\paragraph*{Solution}
First, we check if it is CSR:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $X: r_1 w_3 w_2 w_4$
    \item $Y: r_2 w_3$
    \item $Z: r_5 w_6 r_7$
\end{itemize}
There is a cycle between two and three, so it is not CSR, but by swapping $w_3 w_2$ we can obtain a VSR schedule without changing the schedule. 

The schedule is not TS-mono because we have $w_3 w_2$ and so also non TS-multi.
