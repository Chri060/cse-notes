\section{Modelling}

Modeling forms the foundation of our existence. Our interaction with the world relies on models that interpret data from sensors, yielding knowledge and guiding actions. 
Moreover, modeling is the means by which we can represent entities in a computer and facilitate reasoning about them.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Model}]
    A model is a representation of an entity, defined for a particular purpose. A model includes only the relevant aspects of the modeled entity. 
    It's important to note that a model inherently differs from the entity being modeled, giving rise to various forms of uncertainties within the modeling process.
\end{definition}
Every Artificial Intelligence application relies on models, which can be either defined by someone or learned. These models are represented in various ways, but they commonly struggle with uncertainties, primarily concerning their inputs.
