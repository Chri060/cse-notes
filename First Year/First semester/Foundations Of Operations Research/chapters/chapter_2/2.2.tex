\section{Definitions}

\begin{definition}[\textit{Exact algorithm}]
    An algorithm is considered exact when it is capable of delivering an optimal solution for every single instance.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Heuristic algorithm}]
    In contrast, an algorithm is deemed heuristic when it is not guaranteed to provide an optimal solution for all instances.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Greedy algorithm}]
    A greedy algorithm progressively builds a feasible solution by consistently making locally optimal choices at each step, without revisiting or reevaluating prior selections.
