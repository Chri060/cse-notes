\section{Strong and weak equivalence}

\begin{definition}[\textit{Grammars weakly equivalence}]
    Two grammars are considered weakly equivalent if they generate the same language, expressed as:
    \[L(G)=L(G^{\prime})\]
\end{definition}
It's crucial to recognize that with weak equivalence, two grammars can generate the same language while still producing different syntax trees. 
The structural aspect is significant, especially in the context of translators and interpreters.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Grammars strong equivalence}]
    Two grammars are strongly equivalent if they not only generate the same language but also produce identical condensed skeleton trees.
\end{definition}
Consequently, it can be inferred that strong equivalence encompasses weak equivalence. 
Additionally, it is noteworthy that the problem of strong equivalence is decidable, whereas the problem of weak equivalence is undecidable.
