\section{Introduction}

To find a solution for a nonlinear equation $f(x)$, we aim to determine $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ that serves as a root of $f$ such that $f(\alpha)=0$.
\begin{definition}
    A point $\alpha$  is termed a \emph{zero with multiplicity m} if the following conditions are met:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $f(\alpha)=f^{'}(\alpha)=\dots=f^{\left(m-1\right)}(\alpha)=0$.
        \item $f^{\left(m\right)}(\alpha) \neq 0$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
When $m$ is an odd number, the function exhibits a change in sign as it crosses the zero. 
In contrast, when $m$ is even, the function maintains the same sign and does not undergo a sign change.
