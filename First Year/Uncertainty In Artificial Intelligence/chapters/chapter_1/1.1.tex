\section{Definition}

\begin{definition}[\textit{Uncertainty}]
    Uncertainty pertains to epistemic situations that involve imperfect or unknown information. 
    It is relevant to predictions of future events, existing physical measurements, or the unknown.
\end{definition}
Uncertainty can manifest in partially observable or stochastic environments, as well as stemming from ignorance, inaction, or a combination of both. 
This concept of uncertainty is prevalent across a wide array of disciplines, such as insurance, philosophy, physics, statistics, economics, finance, medicine, psychology, sociology, engineering, metrology, meteorology, ecology, and information science.

Uncertainty represents a state of incomplete knowledge, characterized by the impossibility of precisely defining the current state, a future result, or multiple potential outcomes. 
This underscores the connection between uncertainty and the necessity to describe an aspect of reality.
