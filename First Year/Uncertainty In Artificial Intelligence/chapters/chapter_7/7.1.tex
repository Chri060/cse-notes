\section{Introduction}

To capture the dynamics of an ever-changing world, a series of random variables describing the state of the world at different time instants can be employed. 
This sequence of states, often representing time, is modeled as a chain. 
A crucial property in this context is the Markov property, which is defined as follows:
\begin{property}
    The Markov property asserts that the transition from $X_{t-1}=x_i$ to $X_t=x_j$ depends only on the current state $X_{t-1}$: 
    \[\text{P}\left(X_t|X_{t-1},X_{t-2},\dots,X_0\right)=\text{P}(X_t|X_{t-1})\] 
\end{property}
In a stationary process, transition probabilities remain consistent across different time points, ensuring that the system's behavior does not change over time.
