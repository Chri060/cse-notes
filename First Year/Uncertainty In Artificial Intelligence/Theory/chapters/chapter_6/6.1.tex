\section{Introduction}

In the real world, random variables often exhibit correlations. To address this reality, it is possible to represent a probability distribution using:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conditional independence assumptions that are valid for a subset of these variables.
    \item A set of conditional probabilities along with their priors.
\end{itemize}
Models that are constructed based on these principles are commonly referred to as graphical models.
