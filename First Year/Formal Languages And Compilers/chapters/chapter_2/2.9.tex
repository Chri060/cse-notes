\section{Strong and weak equivalence}

\begin{definition}
    Two grammars are \emph{weakly equivalent} if they generate the same language, expressed as:
    \[L(G)=L(G^{'})\]
\end{definition}
It's important to note that with weak equivalence, two grammars can generate the same language but still produce different syntax trees. 
The structural aspect is crucial, as it is utilized by translators and interpreters.
\begin{definition}
    Two grammars are \emph{strongly equivalent} if they not only generate the same language but also produce identical condensed skeleton trees.
\end{definition}
Consequently, it follows that strong equivalence encompasses weak equivalence.

Furthermore, it is worth noting that the problem of strong equivalence is decidable, whereas the problem of weak equivalence is undecidable.
