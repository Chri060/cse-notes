\section{Regular expression's ambiguity}

Given the regular expression: 
\[R_1=(a|\varepsilon)^{+}(ba|bab)^{*}\]
Determine whether it is ambiguous.

\paragraph*{Solution}
Firstly, we assign indices to each character in the regular expression, resulting in:
\[R_1=(a_1|\varepsilon)^{+}(b_2a_3|b_4a_5b_6)^{*}\]
Next, we aim to find an ambiguous string to demonstrate the ambiguity of the regular expression. 
A regular expression is deemed ambiguous if there exists a string that can be matched in more than one way according to the regular expression.
For instance, consider the string $a_1$, which can be generated multiple times by selecting $\varepsilon$ $n - 1$ times
This observation establishes that the regular expression is indeed ambiguous.
