\section{Regular expression's equality}

Given two regular expression: 
\[R_1=((2b)^{*}c)^*\]
\[R_2=(c^*(2b)^{*})^*\]
Determine if they are equivalent. 
If not, provide a counterexample.

\paragraph*{Solution}
Upon examination, it is evident that $R_1$ and $R_2$ are not equivalent due to the differing positions of the character $c$ and its potential occurrence multiple times in $R_2$, while in $R_1$, it occurs exactly once. 
An illustrative counterexample is the string $ab$. 
This string is encompassed by the second language ($R_2$) but is not part of the first one ($R_1$).
