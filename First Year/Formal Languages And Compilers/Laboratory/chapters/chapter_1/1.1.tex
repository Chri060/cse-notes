\section{Definition}

Regular expressions represent a highly valuable tool for parsing.
They have widespread industry support and are characterized by their simplicity, ease of composition, and considerable potency.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Regular expression}]
    Regular expressions constitute a grammar defining a regular language.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Regular language}]
    A regular language is one recognizable by a finite state automaton.
\end{definition}
However, a notable constraint lies in the incapacity of finite state automata to perform counting operations, thereby limiting the parsing capability concerning grammars involving parentheses or similar constructs.
