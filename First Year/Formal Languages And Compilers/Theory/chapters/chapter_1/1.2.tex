\section{Operations on strings}

\subsection*{Concatenation}
When you have two strings, $x=a_1a_2\dots a_h$ and $y=b_1b_2\dots b_k$, concatenation is defined as:
\[x \cdot y = a_1a_2\dots a_h b_1b_2\dots b_k\]
Concatenation exhibits non-commutative and associative properties ($x(yz)=(xy)z$). 
The length of the resulting concatenated string is equal to the sum of the lengths of the individual strings:
\[\left\lvert xy \right\rvert = \left\lvert x \right\rvert + \left\lvert y \right\rvert\]

\subsection*{Empty string}
The empty string, denoted as $\varepsilon$  serves as the neutral element for concatenation and adheres to the identity:
\[x\varepsilon=\varepsilon x=x\]
It's crucial to emphasize that the length of the empty string is zero:
\[\left\lvert \varepsilon \right\rvert = 0\]
Moreover, it's worth noting that the set containing this operator is not an empty set.

\subsection*{Substring}
Consider the string $x=xyv$, which can be expressed as the concatenation of three strings, namely $x,y$, and $v$, each of which may be empty.
In this context, the strings $x, y,$ and $v$ are regarded as substrings of $x$. 
Additionally, a string $u$ is defined as prefix of $x$ and $v$ is recognized as a suffix of $x$. 

A substring that is not identical to the entire string $x$ is referred to as a proper non-empty substring.

\subsection*{Reflection}
The reflection of a string $x=a_1a_2\dots a_h$ involves reversing the character order in the string, resulting in:
\[x^R=a_ha_{h-1}\dots a_1\]
The following identities are straightforward and immediate:
\[(x^R)^R=x\]
\[(xy)^R=y^Rx^R\]
\[\varepsilon^R=\varepsilon\]

\subsection*{Repetition}
Repetition, denoted as the $m$-th power $x^m$ of a string $x$, involves concatenating the string $x$ with itself $m-1$ times. 
The formal definition is as follows:
\[
\begin{cases}
    x^m=x^{m-1}x \:\:\:\:\:\: \textnormal{for } m > 0 \\
    x^0=\varepsilon
\end{cases}
\]

\subsection*{Operator precedence}
It's important to note that repetition and reflection operations have higher priority than concatenation.
