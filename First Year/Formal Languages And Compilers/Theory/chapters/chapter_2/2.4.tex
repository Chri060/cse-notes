\section{Recursion and language infinity}

An essential property of most technical languages is to be infinite. We study how this property follows from the form of grammar rules. In order to generate an 
unbound number of strings, the grammar must be able to derive strings of unbound length. To this end, recursive rules are necessary, as next argued. An $n \geq 1$ 
steps derivation $A \implies^{n}xAy$ is called recursive (immediately recursive if $n=1$); similarly non-terminal $A$ is called recursive. If $x$ is empty, the recursion 
is termed left.

Let $G$ be a grammar clean and avoid of circular deviations. The language $L ( G )$ is infinite if, and only if, $G$ has a recursive derivation.
