\section{Regular composition of context-free languages}

If the basic operations of regular languages, union, concatenation, and star, are applied to context-free languages, the result remains a member of the CF family. Let $G_1=(\Sigma_1,V_1,P_1,S_1)$
and $G_2=(\Sigma_2,V_2,P_2,S_2)$ be the grammars defining languages $L_1$ and $L_2$. We need the not restrictive hypothesis that non-terminal sets are disjoint. Moreover, we stipulate that symbol $S$, 
to be used as axiom of the grammar under construction, is not used by either grammar, $S \notin (V_1 \cup V_2)$.
\begin{definition}[Union]
    The union $L_1 \cup L_2$ is defined by the grammar containing the rules of both grammars, plus the initial rules $S\rightarrow S_1|S_2$. In formulas, the grammar is: 
    \[G=\left(\Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2,\{S\} \cup V_1 \cup V_2,\{S\rightarrow S_1|S_2\} \cup P_1 \cup P_2,S\right)\]
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Concatenation]
    The concatenation $L_1L_2$ is defined by the grammar containing the rules of both grammars, plus the initial rule $S\rightarrow S_1S_2$. The grammar is: 
    \[G=\left(\Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2,\{S\} \cup V_1 \cup V_2,\{S\rightarrow S_1S_2\} \cup P_1 \cup P_2,S\right)\] 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Star]
    The grammar $G$ of the starred language $(L1)^{*}$ includes the rules of $G_1$ and rules $S \rightarrow SS_1|\varepsilon$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Cross]
    From the identity $L^{+}=L.L^{*}$, the grammar of the cross language could be written applying the concatenation construction to $L$ and $L^{*}$, but it is better to produce the grammar directly. 
    The grammar $G$ of language $(L1)^{+}$ contains the rules of $G_1$ and rules $S \rightarrow SS_1|S1$. 
\end{definition}
The family CF of context-free languages is closed by union, concatenation, star, and cross. Examining the effect of string reversal on the sentences of a CF language, one immediately sees the family 
is closed with respect to reversal (the same as family REG). Given a grammar, the rules generating the mirror language are obtained reversing every right part of a rule.
