\section{Context-free generative grammars}

Regular expressions are highly effective in describing lists, but they have limitations when it comes to defining other commonly encountered constructs. 
To define more useful languages, whether regular or not, we transition to the formal framework of generative grammars. 
Grammars provide a more robust method for defining languages using rewriting rules.
\begin{definition}
    A \emph{context-free grammar} $G$ is defined by four entities: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $V$ nonterminal alphabet, is the set of nonterminal symbols.
        \item $\Sigma$ terminal alphabet, is the set of the symbols of which phrases or sentences are made.
        \item $P$ is the set of rules or productions.
        \item $S \in V$ is the specific nonterminal, called the axiom ($S$), from which derivations start. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

A grammar rule is expressed as:
\[X \rightarrow \alpha\]
Here, $X \in V$ and $\alpha \in (V \cup \Sigma)^{*}$
If multiple rules share the same nonterminal $X$, we can succinctly represent the rule as:
\[X \rightarrow \alpha_1 | \alpha_2 | \dots | \alpha_n\]
In this case, we say that the strings $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_n$  are the alternatives for the nonterminal $X$. 

In practice, various conventions are employed to distinguish between terminals and nonterminals. 
The following conventions are commonly adopted:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lowercase Latin letters $\{a,b,\dots\}$ for terminal characters. 
    \item Uppercase Latin letters $\{A,B,\dots\}$ for nonterminal symbols. 
    \item Lowercase Latin letters $\{r,s,\dots,z\}$ for strings over the alphabet $\Sigma$. 
    \item Lowercase Greek letters $\{r,s,\dots,z\}$ for both terminals and non. 
    \item $\sigma$ only for nonterminals. 
\end{itemize}
The rules are categorized into the following types:
