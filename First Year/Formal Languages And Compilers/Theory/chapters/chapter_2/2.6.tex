\section{Left and right derivations}

We can have right (expands at each step the rightmost non-terminal) and left derivation (expands at each step the leftmost non-terminal). 
However, for a fixed syntax tree of a sentence, there exist a unique right derivation, and a unique left derivation matching that tree. Right and left derivation are useful to define parsing algorithms.
