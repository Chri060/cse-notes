\section{Definition}

The realm of software engineering is dedicated to unraveling the multitude of challenges that emerge during the creation of extensive software systems.
These systems are inherently intricate due to their substantial scale, the collaboration of individuals from diverse fields, and the necessity for continuous adjustments to meet evolving demands (both during development and post-installation). 

\begin{definition}
    \emph{Software engineering} is a methodical and managerial discipline that revolves around the systematic creation and upkeep of software products, all of which are crafted and sustained within predefined, controlled timeframes and cost constraints.

In contrast to traditional programming, where a programmer typically crafts an entire piece of software based on known specifications independently, software engineers embark on a distinct path.
They identify requirements, shape specifications, design components meant to interconnect with others, and engage in collaborative efforts within a team setting. 
The key competencies of a software engineer encompass technical acumen, managerial prowess, cognitive aptitude, and organizational skills.
