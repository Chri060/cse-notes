\section{Software design description and principles}  

The IEEE has established two standards pertaining to architectural models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item IEEE standard for information technology: software design descriptions.
    \item IEEE standard for systems and software engineering: architecture description (manner in which architectural descriptions of systems are organized and expressed).
\end{itemize}
In accordance with IEEE standards, a Software Design Description (SDD) should encompass the following elements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Identification of the SDD, which includes information such as the date, authors, and affiliated organization.
    \item Description of design stakeholders.
    \item Description of design concerns.
    \item Selection of design viewpoints.
    \item Design views.
    \item Design overlays.
    \item Design rationale.
\end{itemize}
Additionally, there are eleven key design principles that should be considered in the development of software systems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Employ the divide and conquer approach: break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable components.
    \item Maintain a high level of abstraction in designs to minimize consideration of unnecessary details and reduce complexity.
    \item Maximize cohesion where possible to ensure logical and functional consistency within components.
    \item Minimize coupling to reduce interdependencies between system elements.
    \item Design for reusability, allowing various aspects of the system to be used in different contexts.
    \item Promote the reuse of existing designs and code, complementing the design for reusability.
    \item Design for flexibility by anticipating and preparing for future changes in system requirements.
    \item Anticipate obsolescence by planning for technological or environmental changes to ensure software continuity or ease of adaptation.
    \item Design for portability, aiming to make the software compatible with a wide range of platforms.
    \item Design for testability, implementing measures that facilitate testing processes.
    \item Design defensively, exercising caution when making assumptions about how others will interact with the components you are designing.
\end{enumerate}
