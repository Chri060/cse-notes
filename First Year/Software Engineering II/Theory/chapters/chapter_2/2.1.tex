\section{Definition}

The primary measure of success of a software system is the degree to which it meets the purpose for which it was intended.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Requirements engineering}]
    Software systems requirements engineering is the process of discovering that purpose, by identifying stakeholders and their needs, and documenting these in a form that is amenable to analysis, communication, and subsequent implementation. 
\end{definition}
This phase entails pivotal considerations: stakeholder identification, needs assessment, documentation generation, and the analysis, communication, and implementation of requirements. 
An alternate definition is as follows:
\begin{definition}[\textit{Requirements engineering}]
    Requirements engineering is the branch of software engineering concerned with the real-world goals for, function of, and constraints on software systems. 
    It is also concerned with the relationship of these factors to precise specifications of software engineering behavior, and to their evolution over time and across software families.
