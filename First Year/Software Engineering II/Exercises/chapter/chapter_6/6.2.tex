\section{Testing}

Consider the following function \texttt{foo2}, written in a C-like language:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=C]
0: void foo2(int a, int b) {
1:      int x = 1;
2:      if (a>b && a>0 && b>1) {
3:          for (int i=0; i<b; i++)
4:              x = x*a;
5:      if (x < rand(1,10))
6:          print("Log message");
7:      } 
8: }
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run concolic execution to explore all possible branches. 
    \item Write the pseudocode of a possible generational fuzzer that should test \texttt{foo2}.
    \item Given the fuzzer defined in the previous point, what is the chance of executing a path that includes location six?
    \item How much time do you have to wait on average assuming that a single execution takes $\approx 1$ ms?
    \item Consider an SBST procedure with the objective of executing paths that reach location six. 
        Define proper search space, neighborhood relation, and fitness function to use such approach. 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item For the concolic execution we have to run the following test cases to cover all paths: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Test case $\{a = 1, b = 2\}$ executes the false branch of condition two.
            \item Test case $\{a = 4, b = 2\}$ executes the true branch of condition two. 
            \item In this case, the test case $\{a=3, b=2\}$ executes true branch for both conditions two and five. 
        \end{itemize}
        In all this cases we assumed that the \texttt{rand()} function returns always ten. 
    \item A possible generational fuzzer is as follows: 
        \begin{lstlisting}[style=C]
0: int[] fuzzer() {
1:      int b = rand();
2:      int a = rand();
3:      return [a,b]; 
4: }
        \end{lstlisting}
    \item Assume that \texttt{rand()} returns a random integer without constraints. 
        To execute location six, we need to generate inputs that satisfy the following conditions: 
        \[A>B \land B=2 \land A*A<rand(1,10)\]
        The only possible solution is $\{a=3,b=2\}$. 
        Assuming 32-bit encoding for integers, the range is $[-2147483648, 2147483647]$. 
        The total chance is: 
        \[P(a=3 \land b=2 \land \texttt{rand}(1,10)=10)=\left(\dfrac{1}{4,3\cdot 10^9}\right)\cdot\left(\dfrac{1}{4,3\cdot 10^9}\right)\cdot\left(\dfrac{1}{10}\right)=5,4\cdot 10^{-21}\]
        The average number of runs is given by the inverse of the probability, that is: 
        \[\# \text{runs}= \dfrac{1}{P(a=3 \land b=2 \land \texttt{rand}(1,10)=10)}=\dfrac{1}{5,4\cdot 10^{-21}}=1,8 \cdot 10^{20}\]
    \item The execution time is given by the runs multiplied by the execution of each run, that is: 
        \[\text{execution time}=\# \text{runs} \cdot \text{time}= 10^{20} \cdot 0,001 =5.7\cdot 10^{9}  \text{ years}\]
\end{enumerate}
