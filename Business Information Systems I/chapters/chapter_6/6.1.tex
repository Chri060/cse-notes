\section{Introduction}

In today's interconnected business environment, multi-channel integration plays a pivotal role in ensuring consistent service delivery across various customer touch points. 
By leveraging analytic Customer Relationship Management (CRM), organizations can extract valuable insights from customer data, enabling more informed decision-making and personalized experiences. 
Furthermore, executive functionalities within CRM systems facilitate a deeper understanding and real-time monitoring of customer behavior, empowering businesses to anticipate needs and enhance satisfaction. 
Operational CRM complements these efforts by streamlining interactions through diverse distribution channels, including physical stores, sales agents, call centers, web platforms, mobile applications, and direct mail, thereby creating a seamless and cohesive customer journey.
