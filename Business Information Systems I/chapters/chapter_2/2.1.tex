\section{Introduction}

The administrative portfolio focuses on automating organizational activities that are often administrative and bureaucratic in nature, including: accounting and tax management, finance, human resources, project management (from an accounting perspective), and governmental procedures.

This portfolio is largely industry-agnostic, although it is country-specific. 
It represents an early stage of automation, alongside office automation, by streamlining tasks that involve number crunching. 
It typically involves minimal decision-making, as its processes are procedural and repetitive. 
Although traditionally viewed as stand-alone, it often links to other processes.
Despite its simplicity in design, the administrative portfolio can be functionally complex.
