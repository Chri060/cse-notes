\section{Activity Based Costing}

The complete integration of operational, executive, and administrative portfolios within an ERP system facilitates a real-time reconciliation of budgets, resource consumption, operational progress, and cash flows.
This seamless integration is made possible through the implementation of Activity Based Costing (ABC).

ABC links operations directly to their associated costs, enabling organizations to better understand the financial impact of specific activities. 
By associating operations with an internal pricing system, businesses can allocate resources more effectively and gain deeper insights into cost drivers. 
This approach allows for a dual perspective on progress: it can be evaluated from both a project management standpoint and a financial standpoint, focusing on cost efficiency.
