\section{Light ERP}

Classic ERP systems are designed to cater to the complex needs of large enterprises.
These solutions emphasize BPR to streamline and optimize workflows, ensuring alignment with organizational goals. 
They also provide industry-specific functionalities, often referred to as vertical solutions, tailored to meet the unique demands of sectors. 
System integration plays a critical role, allowing businesses to consolidate multiple software systems into a unified platform for seamless data flow. 
However, these systems come with high costs, not only in terms of licensing but also for customization and maintenance. 
Additionally, their implementation typically requires a significant time investment, often exceeding six months, due to the complexity and scale of deployment.

In contrast, small and medium-sized enterprises tend to adopt lighter, more cost-effective ERP solutions. 
These systems, often described as plug and play, are designed for quick and easy deployment without the need for extensive BPR. 
They focus on delivering simple administrative functionalities along with basic reporting tools for straightforward analytics.
While these solutions are ideal for smaller businesses with limited budgets, they offer limited scalability.
