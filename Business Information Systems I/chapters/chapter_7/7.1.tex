\paragraph*{Big data} 
Big data refers to the exponential growth of structured and unstructured data generated daily. 
It brought new challenges in storage, management, and analysis but also unlocked vast opportunities for business intelligence.

\paragraph*{Machine Learning}
Machine Learning marked the next stage of data evolution, enabling computers to learn patterns and make decisions without explicit programming. 
Machine Learning applications expanded rapidly, offering predictive insights and automation capabilities.

\paragraph*{Cloud Computing}
Cloud computing revolutionized data storage and processing by providing scalable, cost-effective solutions over the internet. 
Businesses gained access to flexible computing power, reducing infrastructure constraints.

\paragraph*{Generative Artificial Intelligence}
Generative AI represents the latest frontier, where AI systems exhibit human-like understanding, learning, and application of knowledge across diverse domains.
Its potential is reshaping industries and redefining human-technology interaction.
