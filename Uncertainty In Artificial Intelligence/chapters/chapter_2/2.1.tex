\section{History}

Fuzzy sets were introduced by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965 as a tool to model approximate concepts. 
In 1972, the first linguistic fuzzy controllers were implemented. 
By around 1980, fuzzy sets began to see frequent use worldwide. 
In the 1990s, there was a massive proliferation of fuzzy controllers in various end-user goods. 
Today, fuzzy systems form the core of many intelligent devices.
