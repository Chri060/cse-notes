\section{Introduction}

Logic is a tool that has been employed for thousands of years to formally represent knowledge. There are various types of logic, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Propositional logic}: assigning truth values to propositions.
    \item \textit{First-order logic}: assigning truth values to predicates, involving variables and quantifiers.
    \item \textit{Second-order logic}: dealing with predicates of predicates.
\end{itemize}
These types of logic operate in a binary fashion. 
It's worth noting that the specific meanings of terms within these logics are not inherently defined within the formalism itself, and such definitions are not necessary for the logic to function effectively.
