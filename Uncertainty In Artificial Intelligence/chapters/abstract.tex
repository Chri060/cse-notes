    The course covers various topics on uncertainty and its modeling approaches. 
    It begins with an exploration of different sources of uncertainty that affect models, including their typology, key issues, and suitable modeling approaches. 
    Following this, it delves into measure-based and logic-based methods of uncertainty modeling. 
    The course also includes an in-depth study of fuzzy models, covering concepts such as fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, and fuzzy rules, as well as the motivations, tools, design, and applications associated with fuzzy systems. 
    Additional topics include Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov Models, with an emphasis on their fundamentals, design processes, learning techniques, evaluation methods, and practical applications. 
    Finally, the course explores various applications of these models, discussing motivations, model choices, and specific case studies.
