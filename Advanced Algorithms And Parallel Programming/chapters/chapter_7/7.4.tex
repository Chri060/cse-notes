\section{Reduce pattern}

The reduce operation is a powerful tool for aggregating a collection of elements into a single summary value. 
It is commonly used in parallel and distributed computing frameworks to perform summarization tasks efficiently.

The reduce operation relies on a combiner function that aggregates elements pairwise. 
The combiner function must be associative to ensure that the operation can be parallelized. 

\paragraph*{Tiling}
Tiling breaks the overall task into smaller chunks, allowing individual workers to process and reduce these chunks serially. 
This division ensures efficient workload distribution across multiple processing units.
