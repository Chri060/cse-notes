\section{Scan pattern}

The scan pattern produces partial reductions of an input sequence and generates a new sequence. 
Unlike reduce, scan computes all intermediate results, making it trickier to parallelize effectively.
The scan may be: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Inclusive}: an inclusive scan includes the current element in its partial reduction. 
    \item \textit{Exclusive}: an exclusive scan excludes the current element, producing a partial reduction of all prior elements.
\end{itemize}
One algorithm for parallelizing scan involves two main phases:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textit{Up sweep}: perform a reduction operation on the input sequence to aggregate partial results.
  \item \textit{Down sweep}: use the results of the up sweep to generate intermediate values for the scan.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Tiling}
Similar to reduce, tiling can be applied to divide the work into manageable chunks for individual workers. 
This approach involves:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Breaking the input sequence into tiles.
  \item Performing partial scans within each tile.
  \item Combining the results to produce the final output.
\end{enumerate}
