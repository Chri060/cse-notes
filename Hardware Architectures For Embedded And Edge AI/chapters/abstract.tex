    The goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive understanding of embedded and edge Artificial Intelligence by exploring hardware, software, and algorithmic solutions that support the training and inference of Machine and Deep Learning models on embedded systems and edge computing networks, which are constrained by computation, memory, and energy limitations.

    The course will begin with an overview of smart technologies that enable intelligent, autonomous, and distributed embedded and edge applications. 
    It will then dive into a detailed examination of hardware solutions specifically designed for embedded and edge Artificial Intelligence. 
    Students will also gain an in-depth understanding of the frameworks and toolchains, such as Tiny Machine Learning, that support the training and inference of machine and Deep Learning models on these systems.
    Additionally, the course will cover algorithmic solutions for embedded and edge Artificial Intelligence. 
    A key part of the course will be looking at system-level design for Machine and Deep Learning applications.
