\section{Spoken dialog}

In spoken interaction, participants alternate turns, with each turn ranging from a single word to multiple sentences. 
Turn-taking is fluid and often negotiated dynamically between speakers. 

\subsection{Conversational analysis}
Speech acts represent the functional intention behind utterances. 
Common categories include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Constatives}: commit the speaker to a belief or claim (e.g., answering, confirming, denying).
    \item \textit{Directives}: aim to influence the behavior of the addressee (e.g., requesting, advising, inviting).
    \item \textit{Commissives}: commit the speaker to future action (e.g., promising, planning, opposing).
    \item \textit{Acknowledgments}: express social or interactional responses (e.g., thanking, apologizing, greeting).
\end{itemize}
