    The course will cover several topics, starting with an introduction to basic concepts. 
    Learning theory will be explored, including the bias-variance tradeoff, Union and Hoeffding bounds, VC dimension, worst-case online learning, and practical advice on using learning algorithms effectively.

    In Supervised Learning, key areas of focus include the Supervised Learning setup, LMS, logistic regression, perceptron, the exponential family, and kernel methods such as Gaussian Processes, and Support Vector Machines. 
    Additionally, topics like model selection, feature selection, ensemble methods, and strategies for evaluating and debugging learning algorithms will be addressed.
    
    The course will also delve into Reinforcement Learning and control, examining Markov Decision Processes, Bellman equations, value iteration, policy iteration, Temporal Difference, SARSA, Q-Learning, value function approximation, and the Multi-Armed Bandit problem.
