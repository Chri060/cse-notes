    The course aims to present the main methods for non-linear optimization, both continuous and discrete. 
    Topics include: optimality conditions for both unconstrained and constrained problems, Lagrangian functions, and duality; gradient-based methods, Newton's methods, and step-size reduction techniques; recursive quadratic programming; and methods using penalty functions.
