\section{Particle filter}

Particle Filters are a methodology utilized for estimating non-Gaussian and nonlinear processes by representing belief through random samples. 
This technique, also known as Monte Carlo filter, embodies the concept of survival of the fittest, where the most informative particles prevail. 
Through iterations, the process of condensation refines the particle distribution, enhancing accuracy. 
Another term often used interchangeably is the Bootstrap filter, highlighting the resampling technique at its core.

The computation of belief can be expressed as:
\[\text{Bel}(x_t)=\eta\Pr(z_t|x_t)\int\Pr(x_t|x_{t-1},u_{t-1})\cdot\text{Bel}(x_{t-1})\,dx_{t-1}  \]
For the particle filter we select: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Select a sample $x^i_{t-1}$ from $\text{Bel}(x_{t-1})$. 
    \item Choose a sample $x^i_t$ from $\Pr(x_t|x_{t-1}^i,u_{t-1})$. 
    \item Compute  the importance factor $w_i^t$ for the sample $x_t^i$ as: 
        \[w_t^i=\dfrac{\text{target distribution}}{\text{proposal distribution}}=\dfrac{\eta\Pr(z_t|x_t)\Pr(x_t|x_{t-1},u_{t-1})\text{Bel}(x_{t-1})}{\Pr(x_t|x_{t-1},u_{t-1})\text{Bel}(x_{t-1})}\propto\Pr(z_t|x_t)\]
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{Algorithm}
The particle filter algorithm can be executed in the following manner:

\paragraph*{Monte Carlo localization}
Monte Carlo localization, also known as particle filter localization, is an algorithm utilized by robots to determine their position and orientation within an environment. 
This method leverages a particle filter to estimate the robot's pose as it moves and gathers sensory information within a mapped environment.
