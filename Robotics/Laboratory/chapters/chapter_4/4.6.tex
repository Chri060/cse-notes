\section{Asynchronous spinner}

In standard ROS operation, the conventional approach involves dedicating one thread to each node. 
While this works well for many scenarios, there are situations where a more dynamic and flexible approach is required.

An asynchronous spinner offers a solution without necessitating explicit thread management. 
It allows for real thread implementation behind the scenes, efficiently managing multiple subscribers, especially in cases where computations are time-consuming.

This approach becomes invaluable in scenarios where actions are unsuitable, and it's preferred to handle everything within the same node. 
Asynchronous spinners streamline the processing flow, enhancing performance and resource utilization.
