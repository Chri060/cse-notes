    The course is composed by a set of lectures on autonomous robotics, ranging from the main architectural patterns in mobile robots and autonomous vehicles to the description of sensing and planning algorithms for autonomous navigation. 
    The course outline is:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mobile robots' kinematics.
        \item Sensors and perception.
        \item Robot localization and map building.
        \item Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).
        \item Path planning and collision avoidance.
        \item Robot development via ROS.\@
    \end{itemize}
