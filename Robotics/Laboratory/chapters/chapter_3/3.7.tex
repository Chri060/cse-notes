\section{Custom messages}

To define custom messages in ROS, you typically create them inside a folder named \texttt{msg} within a package, often referred to as \texttt{custom\_messages}. 
Here's a step-by-step guide:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a folder named \texttt{custom\_messages} inside your ROS package.
    \item Inside \texttt{custom\_messages}, create a folder named \texttt{msg}.
    \item In the \texttt{msg} folder, create a file with a \texttt{.msg} extension and a name of your choice. 
        This file will contain the definition of your custom message.
    \item Open the \texttt{package.xml} file of your package and uncomment the following lines to declare dependencies on message generation and runtime:
\end{enumerate}      
\begin{verbatim}
        <build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
        <exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>
\end{verbatim}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [5.] Inside the \texttt{CMakeLists.txt} file located in the \texttt{custom\_messages} folder, add the following lines:
\end{enumerate}  
\begin{verbatim}
        find_package(
        catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
        roscpp
        rospy
        std_msgs
        message_generation)

        catkin_package(
        CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime)

        add_message_files(
        FILES
        Num.msg)

        generate_messages(
        DEPENDENCIES
        std_msgs)
\end{verbatim}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [6.] After modifying the \texttt{CMakeLists.txt}, make sure to build your ROS workspace by running \texttt{catkin\_make} or \texttt{catkin\_build}.
\end{enumerate}
With these steps completed, you can include your custom messages in the header files of publishers or subscribers that require them. 
To do this, include the header file generated for your custom message in your source code. 
For example, if your custom message is named \texttt{MyCustomMessage}, you would include it in your source file like this:
\begin{verbatim}
#include "package_name/MyCustomMessage.h"
\end{verbatim}
Now you can use \texttt{MyCustomMessage} in your code as needed.
