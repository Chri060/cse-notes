\section{Timer}

Inside the \texttt{timer} directory, there exists a \texttt{src} folder housing files with the extension \texttt{.cpp}.
The layout resembles that of a subscriber, but it includes a timer initialized as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
ros::Timer timer = a.createTimer(ros::Duration(1), timerCallback);
\end{verbatim} 
This line sets up a ROS timer to execute a callback function at intervals of 1 second.
