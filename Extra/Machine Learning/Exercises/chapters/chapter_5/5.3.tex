\section{Exercise three}
Consider the linear two-class SVM classifier defined by the parameters $w = \begin{bmatrix} 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$, $b = 1$.
Answer the following questions providing adequate motivations.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Is the point $x_1 = \begin{bmatrix} -2 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ a support vector?
    \item Give an example of a point which is on the boundary of the SVM.
    \item How the point $x_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$ is classified according to the trained SVM?
    \item Assume to collect a new sample $x_3 = \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$ in the negative class, do we need to retrain the SVM?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A point is a support vector if $\left\lvert w^Tx+b \right\rvert\leq 1$, thus:
        \[\left\lvert w^Tx+b \right\rvert=\left\lvert -4+4+1 \right\rvert=1\]
        Meaning that $x_1$ is a support vector.
    \item A point on the boundary has to satisfy $w^Tx+b=0$ thus by considering $x_{11}=0$:
        \[2\cdot 0+1\cdot x_{22}+1=0\rightarrow x_{22}=-1\]
        Thus $x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$ is on the boundary.
    \item A point is classified either in the positive class or in the negative one if $w^Tx+b$ is positive or negative, respectively, thus:
        \[w^Tx_2 + b = 2 \cdot 3 - 1 \cdot 1 + 1 = 6\]
        Which means that the point it classified in the positive class.
    \item The point is misclassified by the current model, as it is
        \[w^Tx_3+b=-2 + 2 + 1 = 1\]
        Which means that $x_3$ would be a support vector, thus we need to retrain the model.
\end{enumerate}
