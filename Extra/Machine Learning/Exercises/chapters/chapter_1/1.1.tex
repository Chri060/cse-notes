\section{Exercise one}

Given the relationship:
\[S = f(T V, R, N)\]
where $S$ is the amount of sales revenue, $T V$, $R$ and $N$ are the amount of money spent on advertisements on TV programs, radio and newspapers, respectively, explain what are the:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Response. 
    \item Independent variables. 
    \item Features. 
    \item Model. 
\end{enumerate}
Which kind of problem do you think it is trying to solve?

\subsection{Solution}
In the proposed relationship we have:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The response (or target or output) is the amount of sales $S$. 
    \item The independent variables (or input) are $T V$, $R$ and $N$
    \item The features (or input) are $T V$, $R$ and $N$. 
    \item The model is identified by the function $f(\cdot)$.
\end{enumerate}
Since the amount of sales $S$ is a continuous and ordered variable, we are trying to solve a regression problem (supervised learning).
