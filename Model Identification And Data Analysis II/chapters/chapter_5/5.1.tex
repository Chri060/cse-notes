\section{Introduction}

The Kalman Filter serves as a powerful tool for prediction and filtering, primarily employed for software sensing variable estimation. 
However, its utility extends beyond these applications, as it can be readily repurposed for gray-box system identification.

It's essential to recognize that while this capability represents a valuable side benefit, it is not the primary objective of the Kalman Filter.
