\section{Kalman Filter with non-White Noise}

The conventional formulas of Kalman Filters are typically employed under the assumption that both $v_1(t)$ and $v_2(t)$ are White Noises. 
However, this assumption can be overly restrictive, as in many real-world scenarios, noise is not white.
A common workaround to this limitation is a general technique known as model extension.
