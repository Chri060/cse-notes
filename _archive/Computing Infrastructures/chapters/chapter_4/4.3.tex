\section{Datacenters dependability}

In data centers, downtime is a significant concern. 
Key components requiring dependability include computing systems, sensors, and actuators (collectively referred to as nodes), network infrastructure for communication, and cloud services for data storage and processing. 
The seamless operation of these elements is crucial for the system's overall functionality.

\subsection{Dependability requirements}
To ensure dependability, a resilient computing system must adhere to the failure avoidance paradigm, which encompasses:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Employing a conservative design approach.
    \item Thoroughly validating the design.
    \item Conducting detailed testing of both hardware and software components.
    \item Implementing an infant mortality screen to identify and address early failures.
    \item Focusing on error avoidance strategies.
    \item Incorporating mechanisms for error detection and masking during system operation.
    \item Utilizing online monitoring tools.
    \item Implementing diagnostics for identifying issues.
    \item Enabling self-recovery and self-repair capabilities.
\end{enumerate}
In practice, dependable systems can be achieved through robust design (emphasizing error-free processes and design practices) and robust operation (employing fault-tolerant measures such as monitoring, detection, and mitigation).

\subsection{Dependability in practice}
Dependability can be enhanced at various levels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Technology}: incorporating reliable and robust components during design and manufacturing.
    \item \textit{Architecture}: integrating standard components with solutions designed to handle potential failures effectively.
    \item \textit{Application}: developing algorithms or operating systems that can mask and recover from failures.
\end{itemize}
However, enhancing dependability typically entails increased costs and potential reductions in performance.

The primary challenges of dependability include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Designing robust systems using unreliable and cost-effective Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components and integrating them seamlessly.
    \item Addressing new challenges arising from technological advancements, such as process variations, stressed working conditions, and the emergence of failure mechanisms previously unnoticed at the system level due to smaller geometries.
    \item Striking the optimal balance between dependability and costs, which depends on factors such as the application field, working scenario, employed technologies, algorithms, and applications.
\end{itemize}
Dependability often involves trade-offs with performance and power consumption, necessitating careful consideration of these trade-offs.
