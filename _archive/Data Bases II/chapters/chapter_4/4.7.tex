\section{Summary}

JPA offers several advantages. 
It eliminates the need to write SQL code, allowing developers to focus on business logic without worrying about database specifics. 
Application code can ignore table names, as the mapping is expressed through annotations with defaults. 
Additionally, there is no need to manually create or destroy database connections or manage transactions; these tasks are handled automatically. 
Business object methods are inherently transactional, providing a default transactional behavior, with annotations available to specify different transaction management policies as needed.
