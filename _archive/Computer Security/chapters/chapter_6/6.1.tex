\section{Introduction}

Networks encompass a diverse range of physical media, topologies, and protocols. 
To effectively manage this complexity, a layered approach is crucial.

In network communications, hosts are uniquely identified by addresses, similar to phone numbers or postal addresses. 
Each layer in the network stack utilizes its own addressing scheme:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Data link layer}: utilizes MAC addresses (for Ethernet), which are globally unique identifiers embedded in the Network Interface Card (NIC). 
        The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to map an IP address to a MAC address.
    \item \textit{Internet layer}: employs IP addresses to identify network hosts globally. 
        It includes both public and private addresses, with private addresses defined by RFC 1918 for IPv4.
    \item \textit{Transport layer}: uses port numbers to identify specific services on a host.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Transport protocols}
Transport protocols facilitate communication between hosts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{User Datagram Protocol} (UDP): a connectionless protocol that provides a lightweight wrapper around an IP packet, primarily adding a port number for addressing.
    \item \textit{Transmission Control Protocol} (TCP): a connection-oriented protocol that manages state through concepts such as closed, open, and established connections. 
        It uses a three-way handshake to establish connections.
\end{itemize}

\begin{definition}[\textit{Denial Of Service}]
    A Denial of Service (DoS) attack targets the availability of a service, rendering it inaccessible to legitimate users.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Sniffing}]
    Sniffing refers to the unauthorized reading of network packets, compromising confidentiality.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Spoofing}]
    Spoofing involves forging network packets, thereby compromising the integrity and authenticity of communications.
