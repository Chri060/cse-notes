\section{Unitary matrix}

\begin{definition}[\textit{Unitary matrix}]
    A matrix is termed unitary if its determinant is one and the inverse is equal to its transpose:
    \[\det (\mathbf{A}) \qquad \mathbf{A}^T=\mathbf{A}^{-1}\]
\end{definition}
\noindent This means that multiplying a unitary matrix by its transpose should yield the identity matrix.
