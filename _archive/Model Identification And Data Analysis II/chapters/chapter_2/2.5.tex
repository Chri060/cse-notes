\section{Optimization}

Our objective is to minimize $J_N(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ with respect to $\boldsymbol{\theta}$:
\[\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_H=\argmin_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}J_N(\boldsymbol{\theta})\]
Typically, $J_N(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ isn't a quadratic function of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$, necessitating iterative optimization techniques for minimization.
The ultimate outcome of this optimization process is our model $\mathcal{M}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_N)$, expressed as:
\[\mathcal{M}(\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_N):y(t)=W(z,\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_H)u(t)\]
