\section{Nash equilibrium existence}

$(\bar{x},\bar{y})$ is a Nash equilibrium for the game if and only if 
\[(\bar{x},\bar{y})\in BR(\bar{x},\bar{y})\]
\noindent Thus, the existence of a Nash equilibrium can be proved by using a fixed point. 

\begin{theorem}
    Let $Z$ be a compact convex subset of an Euclidean space, let $F:Z\rightarrow 2^Z$ be such that $F(z)$ is a nonempty closed convex set for all $z$. 
    Suppose also $F$ has a closed graph. 
    Then, $F$ has a fixed point: there is $\bar{z} \in Z$ such that $\bar{z}\in F(\bar{z})$
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Nash theorem]
    Given the game $(X,Y,f:X\times Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R}, g:X\times Y \rightarrow \mathbb{R})$, suppose:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $X$ and $Y$ are compact convex subsets of some Euclidean space. 
        \item $f,g$ continuous. 
        \item $x\mapsto f(x,y)$ is quasi concave for all $y\in Y$. 
        \item $y\mapsto g(x,y)$ is quasi concave for all $x\in X$. 
    \end{itemize}
    Then, the game has an equilibrium. 
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    $BR_1(y)$ and $BR_2(x)$ are nonempty ($X$ and $Y$ are compact), closed ($f$ and $g$ are continuous), and convex valued ($f$ and $g$ are quasi concave). 
    
    $BR$ has closed graph: suppose $(u_n,v_n)\in BR(x_n,y_n)$ for all $n$ and $(u_n,v_n)\rightarrow (u,v)$, $(x_n,y_n)\rightarrow (x,y)$. 
    We want to prove that $(u,v)\in BR(x,y)$. 
    We have: 
    \[f(u_n,y_n)\geq f(z,y_n)\qquad g(x_n,v_n)\geq g(x_n,t)\qquad\forall z\in X, t\in Y\]
    Taking limits: 
    \[f(u,y)\geq f(z,y)\qquad g(x,v)\geq g(x,t)\qquad\forall z\in X, t\in Y\]
\end{proof}
\begin{corollary}
    A finite game with utilities functions $(A,B)$ always admits a Nash equilibrium profile in mixed strategies. 
\end{corollary}
\noindent In this case $X$ and $Y$ are simplexes, thus the assumptions of the theorem are fulfilled.
