\begin{definition}[\textit{Finite directed graph}]
    A finite directed graph is a pair $(V,E)$ where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $V$ is a set of vertices. 
        \item $E \subset V \times V$ is a set of ordered pairs of directed edges.
    \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Path}]
    A path from a vertex $v_1$ to a vertex $v_{k+1}$ is a finite sequence of vertices and edges $v_1,e_1,v_2,\dots,v_k,e_k,v_{k+1}$ such that $e_i \neq e_j$ if $i \neq j$ and $e_j = (v_j,v_{j+1})$. 
\end{definition}
\noindent The number $k$ is called the length of the path.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Oriented graph}]
    An oriented graph is a finite directed graph where for all vertices $v_j$ and $v_k$, at most one of $(v_j,v_k)$ and $(v_k,v_j)$ can be an edge in the graph.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Tree}]
    A tree is a triple $(V,E,x_0)$ where $(V,E)$ is an oriented graph, and $x_0$ is a vertex in $V$ such that there is a unique path from $x_0$ to any other vertex $x \in V$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Child}]
    A child of a vertex $v$ is any vertex $x$ such that $(v,x) \in E$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Leaf}]
    A vertex is called a leaf if it has no children. 
\end{definition}
