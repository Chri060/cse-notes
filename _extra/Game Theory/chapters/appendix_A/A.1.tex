\section{Binary sum}

We define a binary operation $\oplus$ on the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{0, 1, 2, \dots, n, \dots \}$ as follows.
For any two natural numbers $n_1,n_2 \in \mathbb{N}$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Convert $n_1$ and $_n2$ into their binary representations, denoted as $[n_1]_2$ and $[n_2]_2$. 
    \item Perform the binary addition of  $[n_1]_2$ and $[n_2]_2$ using the standard addition method, but without carrying over.
        This means if the addition of two bits results in 2 (i.e., $1 + 1$), it should be represented as 0 in that position with no carry to the next higher bit.
    \item The result of the operation $\oplus$ is then represented in binary form, which corresponds to the sum computed in step 2.
\end{enumerate}
