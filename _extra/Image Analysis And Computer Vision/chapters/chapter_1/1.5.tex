\section{Pin-hole camera}

To achieve a sharply focused image, it's crucial that each light ray converges precisely onto a single pixel on the camera's focal plane. 
To ensure this, the following conditions must be met:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The distance between the lens and the light source, denoted as $Z(P)$, should be significantly greater than the lens aperture $a$ ideally at least 1000 times larger.
    \item By positioning the screen at a distance $Z$ from the lens, all rays can maintain parallel trajectories as they pass through the lens, resulting in a well-focused image.
\end{itemize}
The camera described is commonly known as a pin-hole camera, and it requires the following characteristics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A thin spherical lens.
    \item Utilization of small angles.
    \item Ensuring that $Z(P) \gg a$.
    \item Maintaining $Z=f$, where $f$ represents the focal length.
\end{enumerate}
