    The goal of this course is to develop the ability to analyze, design, and verify critical systems, with a particular focus on real-time aspects, using formal methods. 
    Key topics covered include Hoare's method for program specification and verification, specification languages for real-time systems, and case studies based on industrial projects. 
    The course aims to provide a solid foundation in applying formal methods to ensure the reliability and correctness of systems, particularly in time-sensitive contexts.
