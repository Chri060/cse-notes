\section{Introduction}

An extensive game is a type of game in which the order of players' actions is explicitly modeled. 
It is commonly represented using a tree structure, known as the game tree, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each node represents a point at which a player makes a decision.
    \item Edges correspond to the available actions from that decision point.
    \item Terminal nodes represent final outcomes of the game, typically associated with payoffs for each player.
\end{itemize}
