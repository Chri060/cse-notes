\section{Extensive game with imperfect information}

n many strategic settings, players are required to make decisions without full knowledge of the prior actions taken by others. 
This lack of informationâ€”such as when players move simultaneously. 
Despite this, such scenarios can still be modeled using a game tree.

In the figure, dashed lines connect nodes that are indistinguishable to a player. 
That is, the player knows they are at one of the connected nodes, but cannot tell which one specifically.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Information set}]
    An information set for Player $i$ is a pair $(U_i, A(U_i))$ satisfying the following conditions: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $U_i \subset P_i$ is a non-empty set of vertices $v_1, \cdots, v_k$.
        \item Each vertex $v_j\in U_i$ has the same number of children.
        \item $A_i(U_i)$ is a partition of the children of $v_1 \cup \dots \cup v_k$ such that each element of the partition contains exactly one child from each vertex $v_j$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\noindent Intuitively, an information set represents the player's uncertainty about their exact position in the game tree. 
The associated partition $A(U_i)$ defines the available actions.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Extensive game with imperfect information}]
    An extensive-form game with imperfect information consists of the following elements:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A finite set of players $N = \{1, \dots, n\}$.
        \item A game tree $(V, E, x_0)$. 
        \item A partition of the non-terminal (non-leaf) nodes into sets $P_1, P_2, \dots, P_{n+1}$.
        \item A partition $(U^j_i), j = 1, \dots, ki$ of the set $P_i$, for all $i$, with $(U^j_i, A^j_i)$ being the information set for all players $i$ at all vertices $j$ (having the same number of children). 
        \item A probability distribution defined for each vertex in $P_{n+1}$ on the edges leading to its children.
        \item An $n$-dimensional vector assigned to each leaf.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\noindent Note that when all information sets contain singletons, the game reduces to one with perfect information.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Pure strategy}]
    A pure strategy for Player $i$ in an imperfect information game is a function defined over the collection $\mathcal{U}$ of their information sets, assigning to each $U_i\in\mathcal{U}$ an element from the partition $A(U_i)$. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Mixed strategy}]
    A mixed strategy is defined as a probability distribution over the pure strategies.
