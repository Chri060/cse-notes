\section{Games}

Game theory extends decision theory to settings involving multiple decision-makers, making it inherently more complex than scenarios with a single agent. 
It provides a powerful framework for modeling a wide range of real-world situations where the outcomes depend not only on an individual's choices but also on the actions of others.

\begin{definition}[\textit{Game}]
    A game is a process composed of the following elements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Players}: the decision-makers involved (at least two).
        \item \textit{Initial situation}: the starting conditions or state of the game.
        \item \textit{Rules}: the set of actions available to each player and how the game is played.
        \item \textit{Outcomes}: all possible end states that can result from players' actions.
        \item \textit{Preferences}: each player's ranking of the possible outcomes, reflecting their individual goals or interests.
    \end{itemize}
