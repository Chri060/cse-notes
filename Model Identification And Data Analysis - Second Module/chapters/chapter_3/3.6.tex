\section{Kalman Filter with non-White Noise}

The conventional formulas of Kalman Filters are typically employed under the assumption that both $v_1(t)$ and $v_2(t)$ are White Noises. 
However, this assumption can be overly restrictive, as in many real-world scenarios, noise is not white.
A common workaround to this limitation is a general technique known as model extension.
\begin{example}
    Considering the system:
    \[\mathcal{S}:\begin{cases}
        x(t+1)=ax(t)+\eta(t) \\
        y(t)=bx(t)+v_2(t)
    \end{cases}\]
    Here, $v_2(t)\sim WN(0,1)$ and $\eta(t)$ follows an AR(1) process:
    \[\eta(t)=\dfrac{1}{1-cz^{-1}}e(t)\]
    Here, $e(t)\sim WN(0,1)$., and $e(t)$ and $v_2(t)$ being independent, direct application of the Kalman Filter is not feasible.

    Expanding the noise model:
    \[\eta(t+1)=c\eta(t)+e(t+1)\]
    Defining $v(t)=e(t+1)$, we obtain:
    \[\eta(t+1)=c\eta(t)+v(t) \qquad v(t)\sim WN(0,1)\]

    Now, by applying state and model extension:
    \[\begin{cases}
        x(t) \rightarrow x_1(t) \\
        \eta(t) \rightarrow x_2(t)
    \end{cases}\]
    we incorporate the noise dynamics into the system dynamics. 
    Consequently, the new system is one order higher than the initial:
    \[\mathcal{S}:\begin{cases}
        x_1(t+1)=ax_1(t)+x_2(t) \\
        x_2(t+1)=cx_2(t)+v(t) \\
        y(t)=bx_1(t)+v_2(t)
    \end{cases}\]
    Now, the Kalman Filter formulas can be applied to this extended system.
\end{example}
