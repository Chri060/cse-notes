\section{Communication}

In IoT, various devices and systems need to exchange information seamlessly.
Industrial environments present unique challenges for communication networks such as timeliness, determinism, and reliability.

\begin{definition}[\textit{Cyclic traffic}]
    Cyclic traffic involves periodic transmissions, ensuring continuous process monitoring.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Acyclic traffic}]
    Acyclic traffic occurs in response to unpredictable events. 
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Multimedia traffic}]
    Multimedia traffic includes images, video streams, and other data-intensive transmissions.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Backhand traffic}]
    Backhand traffic aggregates data flows from multiple sources, consolidating information for centralized processing and analysis.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Key Performance Indicators}
\begin{definition}[\textit{Throughput}]
    Throughput refers to the rate at which data can be transmitted over a network link, typically measured in bits per second or bytes per second.
\end{definition}
\noindent The actual throughput depends on the type of link being used, as different technologies offer varying transmission capacities.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Delivery time}]
    Delivery time represents the total time required to transfer a service data unit from the source to the destination.
\end{definition}
\noindent Measured in seconds, it is influenced by multiple factors, including transmission time, propagation time, and the execution time of network protocols.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Minimum cycle time}]
    Minimum Cycle Time defines the shortest duration needed to complete one full cycle within a control loop. 
\end{definition}
\noindent This metric is crucial in real-time systems, where consistent and predictable execution times are essential for maintaining stability and efficiency.
\begin{definition}[\textit{Jitter}]
    Jitter measures the precision and reliability of periodic operations, particularly in time-sensitive applications.
\end{definition}
\noindent Variability in timing can lead to performance issues, making jitter a critical factor in industrial and communication networks that require consistent and predictable timing.

\subsection{Communication technology}
Defining a communication technology involves several key aspects, starting with the physical infrastructure.
IoT connectivity integrates multiple heterogeneous technologies to ensure seamless communication across diverse environments. 
The classification of communication technologies often depends on their range.

\noindent Network topology also can vary a lot: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Ring topology}: structured flow of data, while linear chains connect devices sequentially. 
    \item \textit{Tree topology}: hierarchical communication, whereas star topology centralizes connections around a single node. 
    \item \textit{Mesh topology}: robust, decentralized connectivity, enhancing reliability and redundancy in complex systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication protocol}
Communication protocols define the set of rules governing the exchange of information between two entities. 
In IoT communication networks, protocols facilitate packet-based data exchange.
Most communication protocols follow a layered architecture. 
This structured approach enhances interoperability, modularity, and scalability in network communication. 
The layers are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Application layer}: handles messages exchanged between applications, enabling services such as HTTP, MQTT, and CoAP.
    \item \textit{Transport layer}: manages end-to-end communication through segmentation and reassembly, with protocols like TCP and UDP.
    \item \textit{Network layer}: routes packets across different networks, using IP-based addressing and routing mechanisms.
    \item \textit{Data link layer}: organizes data into frames, ensuring reliable point-to-point or point-to-multi point transmission.
    \item \textit{Physical layer}: deals with the actual transmission of raw bits over physical media such as wired or wireless connections.
\end{itemize}
