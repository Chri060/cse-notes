\section{Introduction}

\begin{definition}[\textit{Application}]
    An application refers to a program running on a host that can communicate with another program over a network.
\end{definition}
\noindent However, communication technologies are highly fragmented. 
Different protocols and languages coexist, often creating compatibility challenges. 
Many field-level and factory-level technologies do not natively support Internet-based communication.
A practical solution to this fragmentation is the adoption of service oriented architectures. 

\subsection{Taxonomy}
The application layer protocols can be classified as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Client and server} (HTTP and CoAP): a client requests data from a server. 
    \item \textit{Publish and subscribe} (MQTT): devices publish data to a central broker, which then distributes updates to subscribed clients. 
\end{itemize}
