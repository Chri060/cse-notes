\section{Context-free generative grammars}

Regular expressions are highly effective in describing lists, but they have limitations when it comes to defining other commonly encountered constructs. 
To address this, for more versatile language definition, whether regular or not, we turn to the formal framework of generative grammars.
Grammars offer a robust method for language definition through rewriting rules.

\paragraph*{Context-free grammar}
A context-free grammar $G$ is characterized by four components:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $V$: the nonterminal alphabet, representing the set of nonterminal symbols.
    \item $\Sigma$: the terminal alphabet, comprising the symbols from which phrases or sentences are constructed.
    \item $P$: the set of rules or productions.
    \item $S \in V$: the specific nonterminal, referred to as the axiom ($S$), from which derivations commence.
\end{enumerate}
A grammar rule is formally denoted as:
\[X \rightarrow \alpha\]
In this expression, $X \in V$ and $\alpha \in (V \cup \Sigma)^{\ast}$
When multiple rules involve the same nonterminal $X$, these rules can be concisely expressed as:
\[X \rightarrow \alpha_1 \mid \alpha_2 \mid \dots \mid \alpha_n\]
In this context, the strings $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_n$ are termed alternatives for the nonterminal $X$.

\paragraph*{Representation conventions}
In practical usage, various conventions are employed to distinguish between terminals and nonterminals. 
The following conventions are commonly adopted:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lowercase Latin letters $\{a,b,\dots\}$ are used for terminal characters.
    \item Uppercase Latin letters $\{A,B,\dots\}$ are reserved for nonterminal symbols.
    \item Lowercase Latin letters $\{r,s,\dots,z\}$ represent strings over the alphabet $\Sigma$.
    \item Lowercase Greek letters $\{r,s,\dots,z\}$ may be used for both terminals and nonterminals.
    \item The symbol $\sigma$ is exclusively employed for nonterminals.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Rule classification}
The rules can be classified into the following types:
