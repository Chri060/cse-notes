\section{Triangulation}

In triangulation, the 3D scene point $\mathbf{X}$ is determined by the intersection of two viewing rays:
\begin{itemize}
    \item One viewing ray is associated with image point $\mathbf{x}$ and originates from camera $\mathbf{P}$. 
    \item The other viewing ray is associated with image point $\mathbf{x}^\prime$  and originates from camera $\mathbf{P}^\prime$. 
\end{itemize}
This process finds the 3D point $\mathbf{X}$ by intersecting the rays in space.

\begin{theorem}
    A fundamental matrix $\mathbf{F}_{12}$ is compatible with the camera pairs $(\mathbf{P}_1,\mathbf{P}_2)$ and $(\mathbf{P}_1^\prime,\mathbf{P}_2^\prime)$ if and only if the camera pairs are projectively related.
    Specifically, there exists an invertible ${4\times 4}$ matrix $\mathbf{H}$ such that:
    \[\mathbf{P}_1^\prime=\mathbf{P}_1\mathbf{H}^{-1} \qquad \mathbf{P}_2^\prime=\mathbf{P}_2\mathbf{H}^{-1}\]
\end{theorem}
This means that the camera matrices of two projectively related camera pairs are connected through a transformation matrix $\mathbf{H}$.
Thus, the images captured by both pairs are the same, even if the cameras themselves are modified, as long as they remain related by a projective transformation.

The fundamental matrix $\mathbf{F}_{12}$ remains invariant for two camera pairs that are projectively related. 
Specifically:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Any set of images of a scene can be transformed through a projective transformation, leading to identical images if the camera matrices are adjusted accordingly.
    \item If two camera pairs are projectively related, they will share the same fundamental matrix $\mathbf{F}_{12}$. 
\end{itemize}
If the cameras $\mathbf{P}_1=\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{I}  \mid  \mathbf{0} \end{bmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{P}_2=\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A} \mid \mathbf{a} \end{bmatrix}$ are compatible with the fundamental matrix $\mathbf{F}_{12}$, then the modified camera matrices
also cameras $\mathbf{P}_1^\prime=\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{I} \mid \mathbf{0} \end{bmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{P}_2^\prime=\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A}+\mathbf{av}^T \mid \lambda\mathbf{a} \end{bmatrix}$, for any vector $\mathbf{v}$ and scalar $\lambda$, are also compatible with the same fundamental matrix $\mathbf{F}_{12}$.
