\section{Path of a light ray}

To determine the trajectory of a light ray as it passes through a lens at any given position, you can follow these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw a line parallel to the selected ray, passing through the center of the lens.
    \item Identify the intersection point of this line with the focal plane.
    \item The ray will travel from the point where it crosses the lens to the point on the focal plane.
\end{enumerate}
