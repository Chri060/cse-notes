\section{Calibration matrix}

The calibration matrix, also known as the intrinsic matrix, is defined as:
\[\mathbf{K}=\begin{bmatrix} f_x & 0 & U_0 \\ 0 & f_y & V_0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}\]
Here, $f_x$ and $f_y$ are the focal lengths in pixel units along the $x$- and $y$-axes, respectively, and $(U_0,V_0)$ represents the principal point. 

The intrinsic parameters are properties of the camera itself and remain constant regardless of its position or orientation in space. 
Key invariant factors include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The principal point coordinates $U_0$ and $V_0$, which define the relative position of the camera center with respect to the image plane.
    \item The pixel aspect ratio, defined as $a=\frac{f_x}{f_y}$. 
    For most natural cameras with square pixels, $a$ is equal to $1$.
\end{itemize}
\noindent Considering the full projection model, the camera projection matrix is given by:
\[\mathbf{P}=\mathbf{K}\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{R} & \mathbf{t}\end{bmatrix}\]
Here, $\mathbf{R}$ is the rotation matrix, and $\mathbf{t}$ is the translation vector.
These extrinsic parameters describe the cameraâ€™s pose relative to the world coordinate system, determining how the 3D scene is mapped onto the image plane.
