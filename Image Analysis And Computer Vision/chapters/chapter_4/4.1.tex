\section{Introduction}

In spatial geometry, fundamental elements such as points, planes, quadrics, and dual quadrics serve as the building blocks for defining geometric relationships and structures. 
These elements are manipulated through various types of transformations, each preserving different geometric properties. 
The principal transformations include: projectivities, affinities, similarities, and isometries.
